<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Larva and Imago vary in Structure independently
of each other.</span></span></h4>

<p>It would be meaningless to assert that the two
stages above mentioned were <i>completely</i> independent
of one another. It is obvious that the amount
of organic and living matter contained in the caterpillar
determines the size of the butterfly, and that
the quantity of organic matter in the egg must determine
the size of the emergent larva. The assertion
in the above heading refers only to the
structure; but even for this it cannot be taken as
signifying an absolute, but only a relative independence,
which, however, certainly obtains in a
very high degree. Although it is conceivable
that every change of structure in the imago may
entail a correlative change of structure in the larva,
no such cases have as yet been proved; on the
contrary, all facts indicate an almost complete independence
of the two stages. It is quite different
with cases of <i>indirect</i> dependence, such, for example,
as are brought about by ‘nurse-breeding.’ This
phenomenon is almost completely absent in Lepidoptera,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
but is found in Diptera, and especially in
Hymenoptera in every degree. The larvæ of
ichneumons which live in other insects, require
(not always, but in most instances) that the female
imago should possess a sharp ovipositor, so that
in this case also the structure and mode of life of
the larva influences the perfect insect. This does
not depend, however, on inherent laws of growth
(correlation), but on the action of external
influences, to which the organism endeavours to
adapt itself by natural selection.</p>

<p>I will now let the facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p>It is shown by those species in which only one
stage is di- or polymorphic that not every change
in the one stage entails a corresponding change
in the other. Thus, in all seasonally dimorphic
species we find that the caterpillars of butterflies
which are often widely different in the colour
and marking of their successive generations are
absolutely identical. On the other hand, many
species can be adduced of which the larvæ are
dimorphic whilst the imagines occur only in one
form (compare the first and second essays in this
volume).</p>

<p>There are however facts which directly prove
that any one stage can change independently of
the others; I refer to the circumstance that any
one stage may become independently variable&mdash;that
the property of greater variability or of
greater constancy by no means always occurs in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
equal degree in all the three stages of larva, pupa,
and imago, but that sometimes the caterpillar is
very variable and the pupa and imago quite
constant. On the other hand, all three stages may
be equally variable or equally constant, although
this seldom occurs.</p>

<p>If variability is to be understood as indicating
the period of re-modelling of a living form, whether
in its totality or only in single characters or groups
of characters, from the simple fact of the heterochronic
variability of the ontogenetic stages, it follows
that the latter can be modified individually,
and that the re-modelling of one stage by no
means necessarily entails that of the others. It
cannot however be doubted that variability, from
whatever cause it may have arisen, is in all cases
competent to produce a new form. From the
continued crossing of variable individuals alone,
an equalization of differences must at length take
place, and with this a new, although not always a
widely deviating, constant form must arise.</p>

<p>That the different stages of development of a
species may actually be partly variable and partly
constant, and that the variable or constant character
of one stage has no influence on the other
stages, is shown by the following cases, which are,
at the same time, well adapted to throw light on
the causes of variability, and are thus calculated to
contribute towards the solution of the main problem
with which this investigation is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>When, in the following pages, I speak of
<i>variability</i>, I do not refer to the occurrence of local
varieties, or to variations which occur in the course
of time, but I mean a high degree of individual
variability&mdash;a considerable fluctuation of characters
in the individuals of one and the same district or of
the same brood. I consider a species to be constant,
on the other hand, when the individuals from
a small or large district differ from one another
only to a very slight extent. Constant forms are
likewise generally, but not invariably, such as are
poor in local varieties, whilst variable forms are
those which are rich in such variations. Since the
terms “variable” and “constant” are but relative,
I will confine myself to the most extreme cases,
those in which the individual peculiarities fluctuate
within very wide or very narrow limits.</p>

<p>As no observations upon the degree of variability
shown by a species in the different stages of
its development were available, I was obliged to
fall back upon my own, at least so far as relates
to the larval and pupal stages, whilst for the
imaginal stage the wide experience of my esteemed
friend Dr. Staudinger has been of essential service
to me.</p>

<p>Let us in the first place confine our attention to
the three chief forms which every Lepidopteron
presents, viz. larva, pupa, and imago. With
respect to the constancy or variability of these
three forms, we actually find in nature all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
combinations which are theoretically conceivable.</p>

<p>(1.) There are species which possess a high
degree of constancy in all three stages, such, for
example, as <i>Limenitis Camilla</i>, <i>Pieris Brassicæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
<i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>, and <i>Euchelia Jacobææ</i>.</p>

<p>(2.) There are species showing a high degree
of variability in all three stages. This case must
be of rare occurrence, as I am only able to adduce
<i>Araschnia Prorsa-Levana</i>, a fact which arises
from the circumstance that the pupal stage is, as a
rule, but seldom variable.</p>

<p>(3.) There are species which are variable in two
stages and constant in the third. To this class,
for example, belongs <i>Smerinthus Tiliæ</i>, of which
the larva and imago are very variable, whilst the
pupa is quite constant. The same is the case
with <i>Lasiocampa Pini</i>, the well-known fir moth.
Many butterflies show this same phenomenon in
other combinations, such, for instance, as <i>Vanessa
Urticæ</i> and <i>Polychloros</i>, in which the larva and
pupa are very variable, and the imago very constant.
In a less degree the same is also the case
with <i>Vanessa Atalanta</i>, whilst in <i>Pieris Napi</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
pupa and imago are variable, and the caterpillar
remarkably constant, this likewise being the case
with the local form <i>Bryoniæ</i>, which, according to my
theory, is to be regarded as the parent form of
<i>Napi</i> (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#P1">Part I.</a> of the present volume).</p>

<p>(4.) There are species which are constant in
two stages, and variable only in the third. Thus,
a few species can be found in which the larva and
pupa are constant and the imago variable. This
is the case with <i>Saturnia Yamamai</i>, the imago of
which is well known to present numberless shades
of colour, varying from light yellow to greyish
black, whilst the green caterpillar shows only
slight individual differences of marking, and
scarcely any differences of colour. The pupa of
this species is quite constant. <i>Arctia Caja</i> and
<i>Hebe</i>, and <i>Chelonia Plantaginis</i> belong to this
same category.</p>

<p>There are a very large number of species which
possess very constant imagines and pupæ, but
extremely variable larvæ. The following are the
cases known to me:&mdash;<i>Macroglossa Stellatarum</i>,
<i>Fuciformis</i> and <i>Bombyliformis</i>; <i>Chærocampa
Elpenor</i>, <i>Celerio</i>, and <i>Nerii</i>; <i>Deilephila Galii</i>,
<i>Livornica</i>, Hübn., <i>Hippophaës</i>, <i>Vespertilio</i>, and
<i>Zygophylli</i>; <i>Sphinx Convolvuli</i>; <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>;
<i>Smerinthus Ocellatus</i> and <i>Tiliæ</i>; <i>Callimorpha
Hera</i>; <i>Cucullia Verbasci</i> and <i>Scrophulariæ</i>.</p>

<p>Cases in which the variability depends entirely
upon the pupa, while the larva and imago are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
extremely constant, are of great rarity. <i>Vanessa Io</i>
is a case in point, the pupa being light or dark
brown, or bright golden green, whilst in the two
other stages scarcely any light shades of colour or
variations in the very complicated marking are to
be met with.</p>

<p>The facts thus justify the above view that the
individual stages of development change independently&mdash;that
a change occurring in one stage is
without influence on the preceding and succeeding
stages. Were this not the case no one stage
could possibly become variable without all the
other stages becoming so. Did there exist a
correlation between larvæ, pupæ, and imagines of
such a nature that every change in the larva
entailed a corresponding change in the imago, as
soon as a large number of larval characters became
fluctuating (<i>i.e.</i> as soon as this stage became
variable), a large number of imaginal characters
would necessarily also become fluctuating (<i>i.e.</i>
this stage would also become correspondingly
variable).</p>

<p>There is one other interpretation which might
perhaps be attempted from the point of view of
the old doctrine of species. It might be said that
it is a special property of certain larval or imaginal
markings to be variable whilst others are constant,
and since the larval and imaginal markings of a
species are generally quite distinct, it may easily
happen that a butterfly possessing markings having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
the property of constancy may belong to a caterpillar
having variable markings.</p>

<p>There is a soul of truth underlying this objection,
since it is true that the various forms of
markings which occur in Lepidoptera apparently
reach different degrees of constancy. If we speak
of the constancy or variability of a species, a
different meaning is attached to these expressions
according as we are dealing <i>e.g.</i> with a species of
<i>Sphinx</i> or a species of <i>Arctia</i>. That which in
the latter would be estimated as a high degree of
constancy, in the former would be taken as a considerable
amount of variability. It is of interest,
in connection with the question as to the causes of
constancy, to note that the power of any form of
marking to attain to a high degree of constancy is
by no means inversely proportional to the complication
of the marking, as would have been expected
<i>à priori</i>.</p>

<p>Thus, the species of <i>Sphinx</i> and of allied
genera possess on their fore-wings, which are
mostly coloured with a mixture of dull grey, white
and black, an exceedingly complicated arrangement
of lines which, in constant species, show a
high degree of uniformity: on the other hand, the
checquered fore-wings of our <i>Arctiidæ</i>, which are
far more coarsely marked, always show, even in
the most constant species, well-marked individual
differences. The different types of marking must
therefore be measured by different standards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span></p>

<p>But in granting this, we decidedly refute the
statement that constancy and variability are inherent
properties of certain forms of marking.</p>

<p>This reasoning is based on the simple fact that
a given type of marking comprises both species of
great constancy and of (relatively) great variability.</p>

<p>Thus, the fore-wings of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i> and
<i>S. Convolvuli</i> are extremely constant, whilst the
very similarly marked <i>Anceryx (Hyloicus) Pinastri</i>
is exceedingly variable. Similarly <i>Deilephila
Euphorbiæ</i> is known by its great variability
of colouring and marking, whilst <i>D. Galii</i>, which
resembles this species so closely as to be sometimes
confounded with it, possesses a high degree
of constancy, and further, the Corsican and Sardinian
<i>D. Dahlii</i> is very variable. Among the
family <i>Arctiidæ</i>, <i>Callimorpha Hera</i> and the Alpine
<i>Arctia Flavia</i> are cases of constancy, whilst <i>A.
Caja</i>, which is so similar to the last species, is so
generally variable that two perfectly identical
specimens can scarcely be found together.</p>

<p>The same can be shown to hold good for the
markings of caterpillars. Thus, the larva of <i>D.
Dahlii</i> shows very considerable variability, whilst
that of <i>D. Galii</i> is very constant in marking (disregarding
the ground-colour). So also the larva
of <i>Vanessa Urticæ</i> is very variable and that of <i>V.
Antiopa</i> very constant, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The great differences with respect to constancy
or variability which are displayed by the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
stages of one and the same species, must therefore
find their explanation elsewhere than in the type
of the marking itself. The explanation must be
found in the circumstance that each stage changes
independently of the others, and at different
periods can enter a new phase of variability.</p>

<p>We are here led in anticipation to the main
question:&mdash;Are changes produced by internal or
external causes? is it the physical nature of the
organism which is compelled to become remoulded
spontaneously after the lapse of a certain
period of time? or does such modification only
occur when produced directly or indirectly by the
external conditions of life?</p>

<p>In the cases before us the facts undoubtedly
indicate a complete dependence of the transformations
upon external conditions of life.</p>

<p>The independent appearance of variability in
the separate stages of the metamorphosis might,
however, be regarded as only apparent. It might
still be attempted to attribute the changes to a
purely inherent cause, <i>i.e.</i>, to a phyletic vital force,
by assuming that the latter acts periodically in
such a manner that at first one and then the following
stage becomes variable, until finally the
entire species is transformed.</p>

<p>There is but little to be said in reply to this if
we once take refuge in entirely unknown forces,
the operation of which can be arbitrarily conceived
to be either constant or periodic.</p>

<p>But granting that such a transforming power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
exists and acts periodically, the variability must
always pass over the different stages in a fixed
direction, like a wave over the surface of water&mdash;imago,
pupa, and larva, or larva, pupa, and
imago, must <i>successively</i> become variable. Cases
like that of <i>Araschnia Prorsa</i>, in which all three
stages are variable, may certainly be thus explained,
but those instances in which the larva
and imago are extremely variable, and the pupa
quite constant, are entirely inexplicable from this
point of view.</p>

<p>The latter can, however, be very simply explained
if we suppose the changes to be dependent
upon external influences. From this standpoint
we not only see how it is possible that an
intermediate stage should remain uninfluenced by
the changes which affect the two other stages, but
we can also understand why it should just be the
pupal stage that plays this part so frequently. If
we ask why most pupæ are constant and are relatively
but very slightly variable, the answer will
be found in the facts that all pupæ which remain
concealed in the earth or inside plants (<i>Sesiidæ</i>),
or which are protected by stout cocoons, show
complete constancy, whilst any considerable
amount of variability occurs only in those pupæ
which are suspended or openly exposed. This is
closely connected with a fact to which I have
called attention on a former <span class="locked">occasion,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> viz., that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
dimorphism occurs in certain pupæ, but only in
those which are openly exposed and which are
therefore visible to their foes. I am only acquainted
with such cases among the pupæ of
butterflies, and it is likewise only among these
that I have found any considerable amount of
variability.</p>

<p>Facts of this kind indicate that Nature does
not uselessly sport with forms, but that at any
rate changes of this sort result from external
influences. The greater frequency of variability
among larvæ and its comparative rarity in imagines
is also undoubtedly in favour of this view.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that species with
variable larvæ and constant imagines are extremely
common, but that those with constant larvæ and
variable imagines are very rare. This confirms
the conclusions, already drawn above, first, that
the variability of the imago cannot owe its existence
to the variability of the larvæ, and secondly,
that the causes which produce variability affect
the larval condition more commonly than that of
the imago.</p>

<p>Where can these causes be otherwise sought
than in the external conditions of life, which are
so widely different in the two stages, and which
are much more variable for the larva than for the
imago?</p>

<p>Let us take the species of one genus, <i>e.g.</i> those
of <i>Deilephila</i>. The imagines of our European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
species&mdash;as far as we know&mdash;all live in precisely
the same manner; they all fly at <span class="locked">twilight,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> showing
a preference for the same flowers and very
often frequenting the same spots, so that in the
haunts of one species the others are almost always
to be met with, supposing them to occur in the
same locality. They conceal themselves by day
in similar places, and are attacked by similar
foes.</p>

<p>It is quite different with the caterpillars. These,
even in the case of the most closely allied species,
live under different conditions, as appears from the
fact that they feed on different plants. The latter
can, however, produce changes both directly and
indirectly. The larvæ may acquire adaptive
colours and markings, and these would vary in
accordance with the colour and structure of the
food-plant; or they may become brightly coloured
as a sign of distastefulness in cases where they are
inedible. Then again the colour of the soil on
which the larvæ live would act upon their colours
making these adaptive. Certain habits of the
caterpillars may also be dependent upon the
nature of their food-plants. Thus, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Deilephila
Hippophaës</i> feeds only at night, and conceals
itself by day under moss and among the leaves at
the base of the food-plant; but <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>
could not acquire such a habit, because <i>Euphorbia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Cyparissias</i> generally grows on arid soil which is
poor in vegetation, and which therefore affords no
concealment, and furthermore, because a caterpillar,
as long as it continues to feed, cannot, and
as a matter of fact does not, ever wander far from
its food-plant. A habit of concealment by burying
in the earth also, such for example as occurs
in <i>Acherontia Atropos</i>, could not be acquired by
<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>, because its food-plant generally
grows on hard, dry, and stony ground.</p>

<p>In addition to these considerations, the foes
would be different according as the caterpillar
lived on plants which formed dense thickets
covering large extents of the shore (<i>Hippophae</i>) or
grew isolated on dry hillocks and declivities where
the herbage was scanty or altogether absent; or
again, according as the insect, in conjunction with
such local differences, fed by day or had acquired
the habit of feeding only by night. It must in fact
be admitted that new and improved adaptations,
or, in more general terms, that inducements to
change, when depending on the environment, must
be more frequently dissimilar for larvæ than for
the imagines. We must accordingly expect to find
actual change, or that condition of variability which
may be regarded as initiative to change, occurring
more commonly in larvæ than in perfect insects.</p>

<p>Since facts are in complete accordance with the
results of these <i>à priori</i> considerations we may also
venture to conclude that the basis of the considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
is likewise correct, viz., the supposition that
the changes of colour and marking in caterpillars,
pupæ, and imagines result from external influences
only.</p>

<p>This must not be taken as signifying that the
single stages of the larval development are also
only able to change through the action of external
influences. The larval stages are correlated with
each other, as has already been shown (see the
previous essay): new characters arise in the adult
caterpillar at the last stage and are then gradually
transferred back to the younger stages quite independently
of external influences, this recession
being entirely brought about by the laws of correlation.
Natural selection here only exerts a secondary
action, since it can accelerate or retard this transference,
according as the new characters are advantageous
or disadvantageous to the younger stages.</p>

<p>Now as considerable individual differences
appear in the first acquisition of a new character
with respect to the rapidity and completeness with
which the individuals acquire such a character,
the same must obtain for the transference of an
improvement acquired in the last stage to the next
younger stage. The new character would be
acquired by different individuals in different degrees
and at different rates&mdash;it would have, to a certain
extent, to struggle with the older characters of the
stage; in brief, the younger stage would become
variable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p>Variability of this kind might well be designated
as <i>secondary</i>, in contradistinction to <i>primary</i> variability;
the latter (primary) depends upon an unequal
reaction of the individual organisms to
external influences, the former (secondary) results
from the unequal strength and rate of the action of
the innate laws of growth governing the organism.
In both cases alike exceeding variability may
occur, but the causes producing this variability are
dissimilar.</p>

<p>The different stages of larval development would
thus frequently display independent variability in a
manner similar to the pupal or imaginal stages,
since they can show individual variability while the
other stages of development remain constant. This
appearance of independent variability in the different
stages of the larval development, however,
is in truth deceptive&mdash;we have here in fact a kind
of wave of variability, which passes downwards
through the developmental stages, becoming
gradually weaker, and finally dying out completely.</p>

<p>In accordance with this, we very frequently find
that only the last or two last stages are variable,
while the younger stages are constant. Thus in
<i>Macroglossa Stellatarum</i>, the larvæ are constant in
the first, second, and third stages, but become variable
in the fourth, and in the fifth stage first show
that high degree of variability which has already
been described in detail (See. <a href="#Plate_III">Pl. III</a>., Figs. 3&ndash;12).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
The larvæ, of <i>Vanessa Cardui</i> also, according to my
notes, are extremely constant in the first four
stages in spite of their complicated marking, but
become variable in the fifth stage, although to no
very great extent.</p>

<p>In <i>Smerinthus Tiliæ</i>, <i>Ocellatus</i> and <i>Populi</i> also,
the greatest larval variability is shown only in the
last stage, the preceding stages being very constant.
These cases by no means depend upon
the marking of the young stages being simpler
and therefore being less capable of varying. The
reverse case also occurs. In a somewhat similar
manner as the young of the tapir and wild hog
are striped, while the adult animals are plainly
coloured, the young caterpillars of <i>Saturnia
Yamamai</i> possess longitudinal black lines on a
yellow ground, while as early as in the second
stage a simple green colour appears in the place
of this complicated but perfectly constant marking.
If the young stages are so frequently constant,
this rather depends upon the fact that the transference
of a new character to these stages not
only takes place gradually, but also with continually
diminishing energy, in a manner somewhat similar
to physical motion, which continually diminishes
in speed by the action of resistance till it is completely
arrested. This constancy of the younger
stages may further be due to the circumstance
that the characters would only be transferred when
they had become fixed in the last stage, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
consequently no longer variable. The transferred
characters may thus have acquired a greater regularity,
<i>i.e.</i> a less degree of variability, than they
possessed at their first origination. Extensive
investigations in this special direction must be
made if the precise laws, in accordance with
which the backward transference of new characters
takes place, are to be discovered. By such researches
only should we arrive with certainty at
the causes which determine the lesser variability of
the young larval stages.</p>

<p>It may also occur that the early stages are
variable, whilst the later stages are constant,
although this case appears to happen less frequently.
Thus, the caterpillars of <i>Gastropacha
Quercifolia</i> vary considerably in the second stage
but are constant at a later period, and the same is
the case with <i>Spilosoma Urticæ</i>, which in the
second stage may be almost considered to be dimorphic,
but which subsequently becomes constant.</p>

<p>Cases in which the first stage is variable appear
to be of the least frequent occurrence. I know of
only one such instance, viz., <i>Anceryx Pinastri</i>, of
which the newly hatched larvæ (<a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>., Fig. 53)
show considerable differences in the brownish-black
crescentic spots. The second (<a href="#Plate_VI">Fig. 54</a>), third,
and fourth stages are then tolerably constant, while
the fifth stage again is very variable.</p>

<p>An instance of this kind can be easily explained
by two waves of variation, the first of which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
affects only the first stage, while the second has
just commenced to affect the fifth stage. Such a
supposition is not opposed to any theoretical considerations,
but rather has much probability in its
favour, since we know that species are from time
to time subject to be remodelled; and further,
that the coalescence of several stages of phyletic
development in the ontogeny of one and the same
species (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_226">226</a>, development of the genus
<i>Deilephila</i>) shows that during the backward
transference of one character, new characters may
appear in the last stage of the ontogeny, and indeed
very frequently at a time when the next
youngest character has not been transferred back
so far as to the first stage.</p>

<p>That this secondary variability is to a certain
extent brought about by the conflict between the
old and new characters, the latter striving to suppress
the former, is shown by the caterpillar of
<i>Saturnia Carpini</i> which I have observed for
many years from this point of view, and than
which I do not know a more beautiful illustration.</p>

<p>When these larvæ leave the egg they are black,
but in the adult state are almost bright green&mdash;this
at least being the case in a local form
which, from the district in the vicinity of Genoa
where it is found, I will designate as the var.
<i>Ligurica</i>. Now whilst these two extreme stages
of development are relatively constant, the intermediate
stages show a variability which becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
greater the nearer the last stage is approached,
this variation in the marking depending simply
on the struggle between the green colour and the
more anciently inherited black. In this manner
there arises, especially in the fourth stage of the
German local form, an incredible mixture of the
most diverse markings, all of which can, however,
be very easily explained from the foregoing point
of view.</p>

<p>The simpler and, as I am inclined to believe,
the older form of the transformation is presented
to us in the local variety <i>Ligurica</i>. In the last
stage, when 7.5 centimeters long, this form is of a
beautiful bright green colour without any trace
of black <span class="locked">marking<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Pl. VIII</a>., Fig. 77). The
colour of the six orange warts which are situated
on each segment is also similar in all specimens,
so that this stage is perfectly constant.</p>

<p>Our German <i>S. Carpini</i> shows different characters
in the fifth stage. It is true that individual
specimens occur which are entirely green without
any black, but these are rare; the majority possess
a more or less broad black ring encircling the
middle of each segment (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Pl. VIII</a>., Figs. 78 and
79). Those specimens in which the black ring
has become broken up into large or small spots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
surrounding the base of the warts constitute intermediate
forms (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Fig. 80</a>). The last stage of the
German local form, unlike that of the Genoese
local form, is therefore very variable.</p>

<p>The two forms, moreover, do not simply differ
in being more or less advanced in phyletic
development, but also in several other points.
As it is of great theoretical interest to show that
a species can develop local differences only in the
stage of larva, I will here subjoin the plain facts.</p>

<p>The differences consist in that the Genoese
local form goes through five moults whilst the
German local form, like most caterpillars, has only
four moults. Further, in the Genoese form the
light green, which is also possessed by the German
form in the fourth stage, when it once appears, is
retained to the end of the larval development,
whilst in the fifth stage of the German form this
colour is replaced by a dull greyish-green (compare
<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 77 and 78</a>). There is further a very
considerable difference in the earlier stages which
shows that the phyletic transforming process has
taken a quite independent course in the two forms.
Since the struggle between the green and black&mdash;retaining
this idea&mdash;appears to be quite finished
in the last stage of the Genoese form, we should
expect that the new colour, green, would now also
have encroached further upon the younger stages
than in the German form. Nevertheless, this is
not the case, but quite the reverse happens, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
black maintaining its ground longer in the Italian
than in the German form.</p>

<p>In the Genoese form the two first stages are
completely black, and in the third stage an orange-yellow
lateral stripe first appears. In the German
form this stripe appears in the second stage, and
there is not subsequently added, at least on the
middle segments, a yellow border surrounding
some of the warts of the median series. In the
third stage, however, the yellow (which is but the
precursor of the later green colour) becomes
further extended, so that the caterpillars often
appear of an orange colour, some or all of the
warts and certain spots and stripes only being
black (<a href="#Plate_VII">Figs. 66 and 68</a>). The warts are also
often yellow while the ground remains in most
part black&mdash;in brief, the bright colour is in full
struggle with the black, and an endless series of
variations is the result of this conflict, whilst in the
corresponding stage of the Genoese form almost
complete constancy prevails.</p>

<p>This constancy remains also in the following
(fourth) stage, the caterpillar still being deep
black, only the yellow (sulphur-coloured) lateral
stripe, which has now become brighter, indicating
the impending change (<a href="#Plate_VII">Fig. 67</a>). This takes
place in the fifth stage, in which the ground-colour
suddenly becomes bright green, the black
remaining at most only in traces on the anterior
edges of the segments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span></p>

<p>This is the same marking as is shown by the
fourth stage of the German form, only in this case
individuals quite destitute of black do not occur.
In many specimens indeed black forms the ground-colour,
the green only appearing in certain spots
(<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 71 to 75</a>); in others the green predominates,
and these two extremes are connected by innumerable
intermediate forms, so that this stage
must be regarded as the most variable of all.</p>

<p>The sixth stage of the Genoese and the fifth of
the German form have already been compared
together. The results may be thus <span class="locked">tabulated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
<i>A. German form.</i>                  <i>B. Genoese form.</i><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Stage I.</span> 9 days. Black; constant.                                                                9 days. Black; constant.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Stage II.</span> 8 days. Black, with orange-yellow lateral stripe; variable. Black, with yellow; very variable.                11 days. Black; constant.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Stage III.</span> 5 days (in some cases as much as 16 days).                                           12 days. Black, with orange-yellow lateral stripes; constant.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Stage IV.</span> 16 days (in some cases only 5 days). Bright green and black mixed; very variable.      6 days. Black, with bright yellowish lateral stripe; constant.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
                                   <span class="smcap">Stage VII.</span> Pupation.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span></p>

<p>From this comparison we perceive that the
process of transformation has at least become preliminarily
concluded in the Genoese form. Why
the backward transference of the newly-acquired
character to the young stages has not yet occurred,
or, at least, why it is not in progress, does not
appear; neither can it be stated whether this will
take place later, although we may venture to suppose
that such will be the case. At first sight but
a relatively short time appears necessary for the
single stage V., which is still in a state of fluctuation
(variable), to become constant by continued
crossing, like all the other stages.</p>

<p>That the transformation is still in full progress
in the German form, is shown by the fact that in
this case all the stages are variable with the exception
of the first&mdash;the second stage being only
variable to a small extent, the third to a much
greater extent, and the fourth to the highest
degree conceivable, whilst the fifth and last stage
is again less variable&mdash;so that the greatest struggle
between the old and new characters takes place in
the fourth stage.</p>

<p>Among the innumerable variations presented by
this last stage a complete series of transitional
forms can be arranged so as to show the gradual
conquest of the black by the green, and thus
indicating, step by step, the course which the
latter colour has taken.</p>

<p>In the blackest specimens there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
green but the lateral (infra-spiracular) line which
was yellow in the preceding stage, and a crescent-shaped
streak at the base of the middle warts
together with a still smaller crescent at the base of
the upper warts (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 71 and 81</a>). These spots
become extended in lighter specimens and approximate
so as to leave only narrow black bridges,
a third spot being added at the posterior edge of
the warts (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 72 and 82</a>). The three spots then
extend on all sides, still leaving for a long period
narrow black lines at the boundaries where their
growth has caused them to abut. In this manner
there frequently arises on the green ground a true
hieroglyphic-like marking (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 85 and 86</a>).
Finally the black disappears from the anterior
edge and diminishes on the middle line of the
back where it still partly remains as a T-shaped
figure (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Figs. 73 and 74</a>), although generally
replaced elsewhere by the green with the exception
of small residues.</p>

<p>One point remained for a long time inexplicable
to me, viz., the change of the light green into dark
grey-green which appeared in the last stage in
connection with a total change of the black marking.</p>

<p>Supposing that new characters are actually
acquired only in the last stage, and that from this
they are transferred to the younger stages, we
should expect to find completely developed in the
last stage the same colouring and markings as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
are possessed more or less incompletely in the
fourth stage. Now since the developmental tendency
to the removal of black and to the predominance
of green&mdash;if we may thus venture to
express it&mdash;is obvious in the fourth stage, we may
expect to find in the fifth stage a bright green
ground-colour, either without any mixture of black
or with such black spots and streaks as were
retained in the fourth stage as residues of the
original ground-colour. But instead of this the
fifth stage shows a dark green colour, and a more
or less developed black marking which cannot in
any way be derived from that of the fourth stage.</p>

<p>The Genoese local form observed last year first
gave me an explanation to the extent that in this
form the last stage is actually only the potential
penultimate stage, or, more correctly expressed,
that the same characters which at present distinguish
the last stage of this form, are already more
or less completely transferred to the penultimate
stage.</p>

<p>The apparently paradoxical behaviour of the
German form can be explained by supposing that
before the pure bright green had become completely
transferred to the penultimate stage a
further change appeared in the last stage, the
green ground-colour becoming darker, and black
transverse bands being formed. The marking of
the last stage would then be regarded as the
reverse of that of the preceding stage; the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
of black would be the older, simple black spots
at the base of the warts the next in succession,
and a connected black transverse band the most
advanced state of the development.</p>

<p>Whether this explanation is correct, and if so,
what causes have produced the second change,
may perhaps be learnt at some future time by a
comparison with the ontogeny of other <i>Saturniidæ</i>;
in the meantime this explanation receives support
from another side by the behaviour of the Genoese
local form. If the last stage of the German form
has actually commenced to be again re-modelled,
then this variety is further advanced in phyletic
development than the Genoese form; and this corresponds
entirely with the theory that in the former
the light colour (the orange considered as preliminary
to the transformation into green) has already
been carried down into the second stage, whilst in
the Genoese variety even in the fourth stage only
the first rudiments of the colour-transformation
show themselves.</p>

<p>The Genoese form is to a certain extent intermediate
between the German form of <i>Saturnia
Carpini</i> and the nearly related <i>S. Spini</i>, a species
inhabiting East Germany. In this latter the
larvæ, even in the adult state, are completely
black with yellow warts. This form of caterpillar
must therefore be regarded as phyletically the
oldest, and this very well agrees with the character
of the moth, which differs essentially from <i>S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Carpini</i> only in not being sexually dimorphic.
In <i>Carpini</i> the male possesses a far more brilliant
colouring than the female, the latter agreeing so
completely with the female of <i>Spini</i> that it can
hardly be distinguished therefrom, especially in
the case of the somewhat larger South European
specimens of the last species. Now as the more
simple colouring of the female must in any case be
regarded as the original form, we must consider
<i>Spini</i>, both sexes of which possess this colouring,
to be phyletically the older form, and <i>Carpini</i>, the
male of which has become differently coloured,
must be considered as the younger type. This
completely accords with the characters of the
larvæ.</p>

<p>I must here mention that I have also asked
myself the question whether the variations of the
different larval stages are connected together as
cause and effect&mdash;whether the lightest specimens
of the fifth stage may perhaps not also have been
the lightest individuals of the third and fourth
stages.</p>

<p>Such relationship is only apparent between the
third and fourth stages; the darkest larvæ of the
third stage become the darker varieties of the
fourth stage, although it is true that the lighter
forms of the third sometimes also become dark
varieties in the fourth stage. Between the fourth
and fifth stages there is scarcely any connection of
this kind to be recognized. Thus, the darkest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
varieties of the fourth stage sometimes become
the lightest forms of the fifth stage, whilst in other
cases from the lightest individuals of the fourth
stage there arise all the possible modifications of
the fifth stage. Further details may be omitted:
the negative result cannot cause any surprise, as
it is a necessary consequence of the continued
crossing that must take place.</p>

<p>We thus see that the three chief stages of
development (larva, pupa, and imago) actually
change in colour independently of each other, the
single stages of the larval development being
however in greater dependence upon one another,
and being connected indeed in such a manner that
a new character cannot be added to the last stage
without being transferred in the course of time to
the preceding stage, and at a later period from this
again even to the youngest stage, supposing it not
to be previously delayed in the course of its transference
by unknown opposing forces. On this
last point, however, the facts at present available
do not admit of any certain decision.</p>

<p>But why do the individual larval stages behave
in this respect so very differently to the chief stages
of the whole development? why are the former
so exactly correlated whilst the latter are not?
If new characters have a general tendency to become
transferred to the younger ontogenetic stages,
why are not new imaginal characters first transferred
to the pupa, and finally to the larva?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span></p>

<p>The answer to these questions is not far to find.
The wider two stages of a species differ in structure,
the less does correlation become possible;
the nearer the two stages are morphologically
related, the more powerful does the action of
correlation become. It is readily conceivable that
the more widely two succeeding stages deviate in
structure and mode of life, the less possible does
it become for characters to be transferred from
one to the other. How is it possible, for example,
that a new character in the proboscis or on the
wings of a butterfly can be transferred to the
caterpillar? If such correlation existed it could
only manifest itself by some other part of the
caterpillar changing in correspondence with the
change of the proboscis or wings of the butterfly.
That this is not the case has, in my opinion, been
conclusively shown by all the foregoing considerations
respecting the independent variability of the
chief stages of the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, an endless number of
facts which prove the independence of the individual
stages of development&mdash;I refer to the multitudinous
phenomena presented by metamorphosis
itself. The existence of that form of development
which we designate as metamorphosis is
alone sufficient to prove incontestably that the
single stages are able to change independently
of one another to a most remarkable extent.</p>

<p>If we now ask the question: how has the so-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>called
“complete” metamorphosis of insects
arisen? the answer can only be: through the
gradual adaptation of the different stages of
development to conditions of life which have continually
deviated more and more widely from each
<span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span></p>

<p>But if individual stages of the post-embryonic
development can finally attain to such complete
diversity of structure as that of the larva and imago
through gradual adaptations to continually diverging
conditions of life, this shows that the characters
acquired by the single stages are always only
transferred to the same stages of the following
generation, whilst the other stages remain uninfluenced
thereby. This depends upon that form
of heredity designated by Darwin “inheritance
at corresponding periods of life,” and by Haeckel
“homochronic heredity.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Does the Form-relationship of the Larva
coincide with that of the Imago?</span></span></h4>

<p>Having thus established the independence in
the variability of the individual stages of metamorphosis,
I will now turn to the consideration
of the question as to how far a parallelism is
displayed in the phyletic development of these
stages. Is there a complete congruence of form-relationship
between larvæ on the one hand and
imagines on the other? does the classification
founded on the morphology of the imagines agree
with that based on the morphology of the larvæ
or not?</p>

<p>If, according to <span class="locked">Claus,<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> we divide the order
Lepidoptera into six great groups of families, it is
at once seen that these groups, which were
originally founded exclusively on imaginal characters,
cannot by any means be so clearly and
sharply defined by the larval characters.</p>

<p>This is certainly the case with the <i>Geometræ</i>,
of which the larvæ possess only ten legs, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
this account progress with that peculiar “looping”
movement which strikes even the uninitiated.
This group, which is very small, is however the
only one which can be founded on the morphology
of the larvæ; it comprises only two nearly
related families (<i>Phytometridæ</i> and <i>Dendrometridæ</i>),
and it is not yet decided whether these
should not be united into one group comprising the
family characters of the whole of the “loopers.”</p>

<p>Neither the group of Micro-lepidoptera, nor
those of the <i>Noctuina</i>, <i>Bombycina</i>, <i>Sphingina</i>, and
<i>Rhopalocera</i>, can be based systematically on larval
characters. Several of these groups are indeed
but indistinctly defined, and even the imagines
present no common characteristics by which the
groups can be sharply distinguished.</p>

<p>This is well shown by the <i>Rhopalocera</i> or butterflies.
These insects, in their large and generally
brilliantly coloured wings, which are usually
held erect when at rest, and in their clubbed
antennæ, possess characters which are nowhere else
found associated together, and which thus serve
to constitute them a sharply defined <span class="locked">group.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> The
caterpillars, however, show a quite different state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
of affairs. Although the larval structure is so
characteristic in the individual families of butterflies,
these “larval-families” cannot be united into
a larger group by any common characters, and the
“<i>Rhopalocera</i>” would never have been established
if only the larvæ had been known. It is
true that they all have sixteen legs, that they
never possess a Sphinx-like horn, and that they
are seldom hairy, as is the case with many <i>Bombycidæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
but these common <i>negative</i> characters
occur also in quite distinct groups.</p>

<p>In the butterflies, therefore, a perfect congruence
of form-relationship does not exist, inasmuch as
the imagines constitute one large group of higher
order whilst the larvæ can only be formed into
families. If it be admitted that the common
characters of butterflies depend on their derivation
from a common ancestor, the imagines must
have retained certain common characters which
enable them to be recognized as allies, whilst the
larvæ have preserved no such characters from the
period at which the families diverged.</p>

<p>Without going at present into the causes of
these phenomena I will pass on to the consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
of further facts, and will now proceed to investigate
both the form-relationships within the
families. Here there can be no doubt that in an
overwhelmingly large majority of cases the phyletic
development has proceeded with very close
parallelism in both stages; larval and imaginal
families agree almost completely.</p>

<p>Thus, under the group <i>Rhopalocera</i> there is a
series of families which equally well permit of
their being founded on the structure of the larva
or on that of the imago, and in which the larvæ
and imagines therefore deviate from one another
to the same extent. This is the case, for instance,
with the families of the <i>Pieridæ</i>, <i>Papilionidæ</i>,
<i>Danaidæ</i>, and <i>Lycænidæ</i>.</p>

<p>But there are also families of which the limits
would be very different if the larvæ were made the
basis of the classification instead of the butterflies
as heretofore. To this category belongs the sub-family
<i>Nymphalinæ</i>. Here also a very characteristic
form of caterpillar indeed prevails, but it
does not occur in all the genera, being replaced in
some by a quite different form of larva.</p>

<p>In the latest catalogue of Diurnal Lepidoptera,
that of Kirby (1871), 112 genera are comprised
under this family. Of these most of the larvæ
possess one or several rows of spines on most or
on all the segments, a character which, as thus disposed,
is not met with in any other family.</p>

<p>This character is noticeable in genera 1 to 90,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
if, from those genera of which the larvæ are known,
we may draw a conclusion with reference to their
allies. I am acquainted with larvæ of genus 2,
<i>Agraulis</i>, Boisd. (<i>Dione</i>, Hübn.); of genus 3,
<i>Cethosia</i>, Fabr.; 10, <i>Atella</i>, Doubl.; 12, <i>Argynnis</i>,
Fabr.; 13, <i>Melitæa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Fabr.; 19, <i>Araschnia</i>, Hübn.;
22, <i>Vanessa</i>, Fabr.; 23, <i>Pyrameis</i>, Hübn.; 24,
<i>Junonia</i>, Hübn.; 31, <i>Ergolis</i>, Boisd.; 65, <i>Hypolimnas</i>,
Hübn. (<i>Diadema</i>, Boisd.); 77, <i>Limenitis</i>,
Fabr.; 81, <i>Neptis</i>, Fabr.; 82, <i>Athyma</i>, Westw.;
and finally with those of genus 90, <i>Euthalia</i>,
Hübn.&mdash;which, according to Horsfield’s figures,
possess only two rows of spines, these being remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
long and curved, and fringing both sides.
It may be safely assumed that the intermediate
genera would agree in possessing this important
character of the Nymphalideous larvæ, viz., spines.</p>

<p>After the genus 90 there are 22 more genera,
and these are spineless, at least in the case of the
two chief genera, 93, <i>Apatura</i>, and 104, <i>Nymphalis</i>.
Of the remainder I know neither figures nor
<span class="locked">descriptions.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> In the two genera named the larvæ
are provided with two or more spine-like tentacles
on the head, and the last segment ends in a fork-like
process directed backwards. The body is
otherwise smooth, and differs also in form from
that of the larvæ of the other <i>Nymphalinæ</i>, being
thickest in the middle, and tapering anteriorly and
posteriorly; neither is the form cylindrical, but
somewhat flattened and slug-shaped. If therefore
we were to arrange these butterflies by the larvæ
instead of by the imagines, these two genera and
their allies would form a distinct family, and could
not remain associated with the 90 other Nymphalideous
genera.</p>

<p>We have here a case of <i>incongruence</i>; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
imagines of the genera 1&ndash;90 and 91&ndash;112 are
more closely allied than their larvæ.</p>

<p>From still another side there arises a similar
disagreement. The larvæ of the genera <i>Apatura</i>
and <i>Nymphalis</i> agree very closely in their bodily
form and in their forked caudal appendage with
the caterpillars of another sub-family of butterflies,
the <i>Satyrinæ</i>, whilst their imagines differ chiefly
from those of the latter sub-family in the absence
of an enlargement of certain veins of the fore-wings,
an essential character of the <i>Satyrinæ</i>.</p>

<p>This double disagreement has also been noticed
by those systematists who have taken the form of
the caterpillar into consideration. Thus, <span class="locked">Morris<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span>
attempted to incorporate the genera <i>Apatura</i> and
<i>Nymphalis</i> into the family <i>Libytheidæ</i>, placing the
latter as transitional from the <i>Nymphalidæ</i> to the
<i>Satyridæ</i>. But although the imagines of the genera
<i>Apatura</i>, <i>Nymphalis</i>, and <i>Libythea</i> may be most
closely related&mdash;as I believe they actually are&mdash;the
larvæ are widely different, being at least as
different as are those of <i>Apatura</i> and <i>Nymphalis</i>
from the remaining <i>Nymphalinæ</i>.</p>

<p>Now if we could safely raise <i>Apatura</i> and
<i>Nymphalis</i> into a distinct family&mdash;an arrangement
which in the estimation of <span class="locked">Staudinger<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> is correct&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>and
if this were interpolated between the <i>Satyridæ</i>
and <i>Nymphalidæ</i>, such an arrangement could only
be based on the larval structure, and that of the
imagines would thus remain unconsidered, since
no other common characters can be found for these
two genera than those which they possess in
common with the other Nymphalideous genera.</p>

<p>The emperor-butterflies (<i>Apatura</i>), by the ocelli
of their fore-wings certainly put us somewhat in
mind of the <i>Satyrinæ</i>, in which such spots are
always present; but this character does not occur
in the genus <i>Nymphalis</i>, and is likewise absent in
most of the other genera of this group. The
genus <i>Apatura</i> shows in addition a most striking
similarity in the markings of the wings to the
purely Nymphalideous genus <i>Limenitis</i>, and it is
therefore placed, by those systematists who leave
this genus in the same family, in the closest
proximity to <i>Limenitis</i>. This resemblance cannot
depend upon mimicry, since not only one or
another but <i>all</i> the species of the two genera
possess a similar marking; and further, because
similarity of marking alone does not constitute
mimicry, but a resemblance in colour must also be
added. The genus <i>Limenitis</i> actually contains a
case of imitation, but in quite another direction;
this will be treated of subsequently.</p>

<p>It cannot therefore be well denied that in this
case the larvæ show different relationships to the
imagines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span></p>

<p>If the “natural” system is the expression of the
genetic relationship of living forms, the question
arises in this and in similar cases as to whether
the more credence is to be attached to the larvæ
or to the imagines&mdash;or, in more scientific phraseology,
which of the two inherited classes of characters
have been the most distinctly and completely
preserved, and which of these, through its form-relationship,
admits of the most distinct recognition
of the blood-relationship, or, inversely, which
has diverged the most widely from the ancestral
form? The decision in single instances cannot
but be difficult, and appears indeed at first sight
impossible; nevertheless this will be arrived at in
most cases as soon as the ontogeny of the larvæ,
and therewith a portion of the phylogeny of this
stage, can be accurately ascertained.</p>

<p>As in the <i>Rhopalocera</i> most of the families show
a complete congruence in the form-relationship of
the caterpillars and perfect insects, so a similar
congruence is also found in the majority of the
families belonging to other groups. Thus, the two
allied families of the group <i>Sphingina</i> can also be
very well characterized by their larvæ;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
<i>Sphingidæ</i> and the <i>Sesiidæ</i> possess throughout a
characteristic form of larva.</p>

<p>Of the group <i>Bombycina</i> the family of the <i>Saturniidæ</i>
possess thick cylindrical caterpillars, of which
the segments are beset with a certain number of
knob-like warts. It is true that two genera of this
family (<i>Endromis</i> and <i>Aglia</i>) are without these
characteristic warts, but the imagines of these
genera also show extensive and common differences
from those of the other genera. A distinct family
has in fact already been based on these genera
(<i>Endromidæ</i>, Boisd.). Thus the congruence is
not thereby disturbed.</p>

<p>So also the families <i>Liparidæ</i>, <i>Euprepiidæ</i>, and
<i>Lithosiidæ</i> appear sharply defined in both forms;
and similar families occur likewise under the
<i>Noctuina</i>, although in this group the erection of
families presents great difficulties owing to the
near relationship of the genera, and is always to
some extent arbitrary. It is important, however,
that it is precisely the transitional families which
present intermediate forms both as larvæ and as
imagines.</p>

<p>Such an instance is offered by the <i>Acronyctidæ</i>,
a family belonging to the group <i>Noctuina</i>. The
imagines here show in certain points an approximation
to the group <i>Bombycina</i>; and their larvæ,
which are thickly covered with hairs, likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
possess the characteristics of many of the caterpillars
of this <span class="locked">group.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span></p>

<p>A second illustration is furnished by the family
<i>Ophiusidæ</i>, which is still placed by all systematists
under the <i>Noctuina</i>, its affinity to the <i>Geometrina</i>,
however, being represented by its being located at
the end of the <i>Noctuina</i>. The broad wings and
narrow bodies of these moths remind us in fact of
the appearance of the “geometers;” and the larvæ,
like the imagines, show a striking resemblance to
those of the <i>Geometrina</i> in the absence of the
anterior abdominal legs. For this reason Hübner
in his work on caterpillars has termed the species
of this family “<i>Semi-Geometræ</i>.”</p>

<p>All these cases show a complete congruence in
the two kinds of form-relationship; but exceptions
are not wanting. Thus, the family <i>Bombycidæ</i>
would certainly never have been formed if the
larval structure only had been taken into consideration,
since, whilst the genera <i>Gastropacha</i>,
<i>Clisiocampa</i>, <i>Lasiocampa</i>, <i>Odonestis</i>, and their
allies, are thickly covered with short silky hairs
disposed in a very characteristic manner, the caterpillars
of the genus <i>Bombyx</i>, to which the common
silkworm, <i>B. Mori</i>, belongs, are quite naked and
similar to many Sphinx-caterpillars (<i>Chærocampa</i>).
Are the imagines of the genera united under this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
family, at any rate morphologically, as unequally
related as their larvæ? Whether it is correct to
combine them into one family is a question that
does not belong here; we are now only concerned
with the fact that the two stages are related in form
in very different degrees.</p>

<p>An especially striking case of incongruence is
offered by the family <i>Notodontidæ</i>, under which
Boisduval, depending only on imaginal characters,
united genera of which the larvæ differed to a very
great extent. In O. Wilde’s work on caterpillars
this family is on this account quite correctly characterized
as follows:&mdash;“Larvæ of various forms,
naked or with thin hairs, sixteen or fourteen <span class="locked">legs.”<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span>
In fact in the whole order Lepidoptera there can
scarcely be found associated together such diverse
larvæ as are here placed in one imago-family;
on one side the short cylindrical caterpillars of
the genus <i>Cnethocampa</i>, Steph. (<i>C. Processionea</i>,
<i>Pithyocampa</i>, &amp;c.), which are covered with fine,
brittle, hooked hairs, and are very similar to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
larvæ of <i>Gastropacha</i> with which they were formerly
united; and on the other side there are the
naked, humped, and flat-headed larvæ of the genus
<i>Harpyia</i>, Ochs., with their two long forked appendages
replacing the hindmost pair of legs, and
the grotesquely formed caterpillars of the genera
<i>Stauropus</i>, Germ., <i>Hybocampa</i>, Linn., and <i>Notodonta</i>,
Ochs.</p>

<p>The morphological congruence between larvæ
and imagines declares itself most sharply in genera,
where it is the rule almost without exception. In
this case we can indeed be sure that a genus or
sub-genus founded on the imagines only will, in
accordance with correct principles, present a corresponding
difference in the larvæ. Had the latter
been known first we should have been led to construct
the same genera as those which are now
established on the structure of the imagines, and
these, through other circumstances, would have
stood in the same degree of morphological relationship
as the genera founded on the imagines.
There is therefore a congruence in a double sense;
in the first place the differences between the larvæ
and imagines of any two genera are equally great,
and, in the next place, the common characters possessed
by these two stages combined cause them
to form precisely the same groups defined with
equal sharpness; the genera coincide completely.</p>

<p>So also the butterflies of the sub-family <i>Nymphalinæ</i>
can well be separated into genera by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
characters of the larvæ, and these, as far as I am
able to judge, would agree with the genera founded
on the imagines.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Melitæa</i>, for example, can be characterized
by the possession of 7&ndash;9 fleshy tubercles
bearing hairy spines; the genus <i>Argynnis</i> may be
distinguished by always having six hairy unbranched
spines on each segment, and the genus
<i>Cethosia</i> by two similar spines on each segment;
the genus <i>Vanessa</i> shows sometimes as many as
seven branched spines; and the genus <i>Limenitis</i>
never more than two branched blunt spines on
each segment, and so forth. If we go further into
details it will be seen that the most closely related
imagines, as might indeed have been expected,
likewise possess the most nearly allied larvæ, whilst
very small differences between the imagines are
also generally represented by corresponding differences
in the larvæ. Thus, for instance, the
genus <i>Vanessa</i> of Fabricius has been divided into
several genera by later authors. Of these sub-genera,
<i>Grapta</i>, Doubl. (containing the European
<i>C.-album</i>, the American <i>Fabricii</i>, <i>Interrogationis</i>,
<i>Faunus</i>, <i>Comma</i>, &amp;c.), is distinguished by the
fact that the larvæ not only possess branched spines
on all the segments with the exception of the prothorax,
but these spines are also present on the
head; in the genus <i>Vanessa</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>),
Doubl., the head and prothorax are spineless (<i>e.g.</i>
<i>V. Urticæ</i>); in the tropical genus <i>Junonia</i>, Hübn.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
which was also formerly (Godart, <span class="locked">1819<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>) united
with <i>Vanessa</i>, the larvæ bear branched spines on
all the segments, the head and prothorax included.</p>

<p>It is possible to go still further and to separate
two species of <i>Vanessa</i> as two new genera, although
they have hitherto been preserved from this fate
even by the systematists most given to “splitting.”
This decision is certainly justifiable, simply because
these species at present stand quite alone,
and the practical necessity of forming a distinct
genus does not make itself felt, and this practical
necessity moreover frequently comes into conflict
with scientific claims: science erects a new genus
based on the amount of morphological difference,
it being quite immaterial whether one or many
species make up this genus; such an excessive
subdivision is, however, a hindrance to practical
requirements, as the cumbrous array of names
thereby becomes still further augmented.</p>

<p>The two species which I might separate from
<i>Vanessa</i> on the ground of their greater divergence,
are the very common and widely distributed <i>V.
Io</i> and <i>Antiopa</i>, the Peacock Butterfly and the
Camberwell Beauty. In the very remarkable
pattern of their wings, both show most marked
characteristics; <i>Io</i> possesses a large ocellus on
each wing, and <i>Antiopa</i> has a broad light yellow
border which is not found in any other species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
<i>Vanessa</i>. There can be no doubt but that each
of these would have been long ago raised into a
genus if similarly marked species of <i>Vanessa</i>
occurred in other parts of the world, as is the case
with the other species of the genus. Thus, it is
well known that there is a whole series of species
resembling our <i>V. Cardui</i>, and another series resembling
our <i>V. C.-album</i>, the two series possessing
the same respective types of marking;
indeed on these grounds the sub-genera <i>Pyrameis</i>
and <i>Grapta</i> have been <span class="locked">erected.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span></p>

<p>I should not have considered it worth while to
have made these remarks if it had not been for the
fact that the caterpillars of <i>V. Io</i> and <i>V. Antiopa</i>
differ in small particulars from one another and
from the other species of the genus. These differences
relate to the number and position of the
spines, as can be seen from the following <span class="locked">table:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This character of the number of spines will not
be considered as too unimportant when we observe
how perfectly constant it remains in the nearly
allied species. This is the case in the three consecutive
forms, <i>Urticæ</i>, <i>Polychloros</i>, and <i>Ichnusa</i>.
Now when we see that two species which differ in
their imaginal characters present correspondingly
small differences in their larvæ, this exact systematic
congruence indicates a completely parallel
phyletic development.</p>

<p>Exceptions are, however, to be met with here.
Thus, Hübner has united one group of the species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
of <i>Vanessa</i> into the genus <i>Pyrameis</i> just mentioned,
on account of certain characteristic distinctions of
the butterflies. I do not know, however, how this
genus admits of being grounded on the structure
of the larvæ; the latter, as appears from the
above table, agree exactly in the number and
position of the spines with the caterpillars of
<i>Vanessa</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>), nor can any common
form of marking be detected which would enable
them to be separated from <i>Vanessa</i>.</p>

<p>Still more striking is the incongruence in the
genus <i>Araschnia</i>, Hübn. (<i>A. Prorsa-Levana</i>),
which, like the genus <i>Pyrameis</i>, is entirely based
on imaginal characters. This is distinguished
from all the other sub-genera of the old genus
<i>Vanessa</i> by a small difference in the venation of
the wings (the discoidal cell of the hind-wings is
open instead of closed). Now it is well-known
that in butterflies the wing-venation, as most correctly
shown by Herrich-Schäffer, is the safest
criterion of “relationship.” It thus happens that
this genus, typified by the common <i>Levana</i>, is in
Kirby’s Catalogue separated from <i>Vanessa</i> by two
genera, and according to Herrich-Schäffer<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> by
forty genera! Nevertheless, the larvæ agree so
exactly in their spinal formula with <i>Grapta</i> that
we should have no hesitation in regarding them
as a species of this sub-genus. It appears to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
very probable that in this case the form-relationship
of the caterpillar gives more correct information
as to the blood-relationship of the species
than that of the imago&mdash;in any case the larvæ
show a different form-relationship to the imagines.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of butterflies there are
many genera of <i>Sphingidæ</i> which can be based on
the structure of the larvæ, and which agree with
those founded on the imagines.</p>

<p>Thus, the genus <i>Macroglossa</i> is characterized
by a straight anal horn, a spherical head, and by a
marking composed of longitudinal stripes, these
characters not occurring elsewhere in this combination.
The nearly allied genus <i>Pterogon</i>, on
the other hand, cannot be based on the larvæ
only, since not only is the marking of the adult
larva very distinct in the different species, but the
anal horn is present in two species, whilst in a
third (<i>P. Œnotheræ</i>) it is replaced by a knob-like
eye-spot. The genus <i>Sphinx</i> (<i>sensû strictiori</i>) is
distinguished by the simple, curved caudal horn,
the smooth, egg-shaped head and smooth skin, and
by a marking mainly composed of seven oblique
stripes. The genus <i>Deilephila</i> is distinguished
from the preceding by a dorsal plate, situated on
the prothorax and interrupting the marking, as
well as by the pattern, which here consists of a
subdorsal line with ring-spots more or less
numerous and developed; the skin also is rough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
“shagreened,” although it must be admitted that
there are exceptions (<i>Vespertilio</i>). The genus
<i>Chærocampa</i> admits also of being based on the
form-relationship of its caterpillars, although this
is certainly only possible by disregarding the
marking and taking alone into consideration the
peculiar pig-like form of the larvæ. The genus
<i>Acherontia</i>, so nearly related to <i>Sphinx</i>, possesses
in the doubly curved caudal horn a character
common to the genus (three species <span class="locked">known<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span>).
Finally may be mentioned the genus <i>Smerinthus</i>,
of which the larvæ, by their anteriorly tapering
form, their shagreened skin and almost triangular
head with the apex upwards, their simply curved
anal horn, and by their seven oblique stripes on
each side, constitute a genus as sharply defined as
that formed by the moths.</p>

<p>Although in all the systematic divisions hitherto
treated of there are cases where the form-relationship
of the larva does not completely coincide
with that of the imago, such incongruences are of
far more frequent occurrence in the smallest systematic
group, viz. species.</p>

<p>The larvæ of two species have very frequently
a much nearer form-relationship than their imagines.
Thus, the caterpillars of <i>Smerinthus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
Ocellatus</i> and <i>S. Populi</i> are closely allied in structure,
marking, and colouring, whilst the moths in
these two last characters and in the form of the
wings are widely <span class="locked">separated.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> Judging from the
larvæ we should expect to obtain two very similar
moths, but in fact both <i>Populi</i> and <i>Ocellatus</i> have
many near allies, and these closely related species
sometimes possess larvæ which differ more
widely than those of more distantly related species
of imagines.</p>

<p>Thus, in Amur-land and North America there
occur species of <i>Smerinthus</i> which closely resemble
our <i>Ocellatus</i> in colour, marking, and form of
wing, and which possess the characteristic large
blue ocellus on the hind-wings. <i>S. Excæcatus</i> is
quite correctly regarded as the representative
American form of our <i>Ocellatus</i>, but its caterpillar,
instead of being leaf-green, is of a chrome-yellow,
and possesses dark green instead of white oblique
stripes, and has moreover a number of red spots,
and a red band on the head&mdash;in brief, in the very
characters (colour and certain of the markings) in
which the imagines completely agree it is widely
different from <i>Ocellatus</i>. It appears also to be
covered with short bristles, judging from Abbot
and Smith’s <span class="locked">figure.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span></p>

<p>Just in the same way that the species having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
the nearest conceivable form-relationship to
<i>Ocellatus</i> possesses a relatively strongly diverging
larva, so does the nearest form-relation of
<i>Populi</i> (imago) offer a parallel case. This species,
which is also North American, lives on <i>Juglans
Alba</i>. The imago of <i>Smerinthus Juglandis</i>
differs considerably from <i>S. Populi</i> in the form of
the wings, but it resembles the European species
so closely in marking and colouring that no doubt
can exist as to the near relationship of the two
forms. The caterpillar of <i>S. Juglandis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> however,
differs to a great extent from that of <i>Populi</i>
in colour&mdash;it is not possible to confound these two
larvæ; but those of <i>Populi</i> and <i>Ocellatus</i> are not
only easily mistaken for one another, but are distinguished
with difficulty even by experts.</p>

<p>In this same family of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> cases are
not wanting in which, on the other hand, the
moths are far more closely allied than the larvæ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
This is especially striking in the genus <i>Deilephila</i>,
eight species of which are allied in the imaginal
state in a remarkable degree, whilst the larvæ
differ greatly from one another in colour, and to
as great an extent in marking. These eight
species are <i>D. Nicæa</i>, <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, <i>Dahlii</i>, <i>Galii</i>,
<i>Livornica</i>, <i>Lineata</i>, <i>Zygophylli</i>, and <i>Hippophaës</i>.
Of these, <i>Nicæa</i>, <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, <i>Dahlii</i>, <i>Zygophylli</i>,
and <i>Hippophaës</i> are so much alike in their whole
structure, in the form of the wings, and in marking,
that few entomologists can correctly identify
them off-hand without comparison. The larvæ
of these four species, however, are of very different
appearances. Those of <i>Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Dahlii</i>
are most alike, both being distinguished by the
possession of a double row of large ring-spots.
<i>Zygophylli</i> (see Fig. 50, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>.) possesses only faint
indications of ring-spots on a white subdorsal line;
and in <i>Hippophaës</i> there is only an orange-red
spot on the eleventh segment, the entire marking
consisting of a subdorsal line on which, in some
individuals, there are situated more or less developed
ring-spots (see Figs. 59 and 60, <a href="#Plate_VII">Pl. VII</a>.).
If we only compare the larvæ and imagines of <i>D.
Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Hippophaës</i>, we cannot but be
struck with astonishment at the great difference of
form-relationship in the two stages of development.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Nicæa</i> this
difference is almost greater. Whilst these larvæ
show great differences in colour, marking, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
the roughness or smoothness of the skin (compare
Fig. 51, <a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI</a>. with Figs. 43 and 44, <a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V</a>.), the
moths cannot be distinguished with certainty. As
has already been stated, the imago of the rare <i>D.
Nicæa</i> is for this reason wanting in most collections;
it cannot be detected whether a specimen
is genuine, <i>i.e.</i> whether it may not perhaps be a
somewhat large example of <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>.</p>

<p>An especially striking instance of incongruence
is offered by the two species of <i>Chærocampa</i> most
common with us, viz., <i>Elpenor</i> and <i>Porcellus</i>, the
large and small Elephant Hawk-moths. The
larvæ are so similar, even in the smallest details of
marking, that they could scarcely be identified
with certainty were it not that one species
(<i>Elpenor</i>) is considerably larger and possesses a
less curved caudal horn than the other. The
moths of these two species much resemble one
another in their dull green and red colours, but
differ in the arrangement of these colours, <i>i.e.</i> in
marking, and also in the form of their wings, to
such an extent that <i>Porcellus</i> has been referred to
the genus <i>Pergesa</i><a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> of Walker. If systemy, as is
admitted on many sides, has only to indicate the
morphological relationship, this author is not to
blame&mdash;but in this case a special larval classification
must likewise be admitted, in a manner
somewhat similar to that at present adopted
provisionally in text-books of zoology for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Hydroid Polypes and inferior Medusæ. This
case of <i>Porcellus</i>, however, shows that those are
correct who maintain that systemy claims to
express, although incompletely, the blood-relationship,
and that systematists have always unconsciously
formed their groups as though they
intended to express the genetic connection of the
forms. Only on this supposition can it appear
incorrect to us to thus separate two species of
which the larvæ agree so completely.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this review of the various
systematic groups without taking a glance at the
groups comprised within species, viz. varieties.
Whilst in species incongruence is of frequent
occurrence, in varieties this is the rule, for which
reason it admits in this case of being more
sharply defined, since we are not concerned with
a double difference but only with the question
whether in the one stage a difference or an
absolute similarity is observable. By far the
majority of varieties are either simply imaginal or
merely larval varieties&mdash;only the one stage
diverges, the other is quite constant.</p>

<p>Thus, as has already been shown, in all the
seasonally dimorphic butterflies known to me the
caterpillars of the two generations of imagines,
which are often so widely different, are exactly
alike; and the same obtains for the majority of
purely climatic varieties of butterflies. Unfortunately
there are as yet no connected observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
on this point. The only certain instance
that I can here mention is that of the Alpine and
Polar form of <i>Pteris Napi</i>. This variety, <i>Bryoniæ</i>,
the female of which differs so greatly in marking
and colouring, possesses larvæ which cannot be
distinguished from those of the ordinary form of
<i>Napi</i>.(See part I. appendix I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_124">124</a>.)</p>

<p>That caterpillars can also vary locally without
thereby affecting the imagines is shown by the
frequently mentioned and closely investigated cases
of di- and polymorphism in the larvæ of a number
of <i>Sphingidæ</i> (<i>M. Stellatarum</i>, <i>A. Atropos</i>, <i>S.
Convolvuli</i>, <i>C. Elpenor</i>, and <i>Porcellus</i>, &amp;c.). The
same thing is still more clearly shown by those
instances in which there are not several but only
one distinct larval form occurring in each of two
different localities.</p>

<p>To this class belongs the above-mentioned case
of <i>Chærocampa Celerio</i> (p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_197">197</a>), supposing our
information concerning this species to be correct;
likewise the recently-mentioned case of the
Ligurian variety of the caterpillar of <i>Saturnia
Carpini</i>; and finally the case of <i>Eriogaster Lanestris</i>,
so well known to lepidopterists. This
insect inhabits the plains of Germany, and in the
Alps extends to an elevation of 7000 feet, where it
possesses a larva differently marked and coloured
(<i>E. Arbusculæ</i>) to those of the lowlands whilst the
moths are smaller, but do not differ in other respects
from those of the plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Alpine species many other such
cases may occur, but these could only be discovered
by making investigations having special
reference to this point. Of the Alpine butterflies,
for example, not a single species can have been
reared from the caterpillar; for this reason but few
observations have on the whole been given by
entomologists respecting the Alpine larvæ, which
are not known sufficiently well to enable such a
question to be decided.</p>

<p>The investigation of the form-relationships
existing between larvæ on the one hand and
imagines on the other has thus led to the following
<span class="locked">results:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We learn on comparison that incongruences or
inequalities of form-relationship occur in all systematic
groups from varieties to families. These
incongruences are of two kinds, in some cases
being disclosed by the fact that the larvæ of two
systematic groups, <i>e.g.</i> two species, are more
closely related in form than their imagines (or
inversely), whilst in other cases the larvæ form
different systematic groups to those formed by the
imagines.</p>

<p>The results of the investigation into the occurrence
of incongruences among the various systematic
groups may be thus briefly <span class="locked">summarised:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Incongruences appear to occur most frequently
among varieties, since it very frequently happens
that it is only the larva or only the imago which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
has diverged into a variety, the other stage remaining
monomorphic. The systematic division
of varieties is thus very often one-sided.</p>

<p>Among species also incongruences are of frequent
occurrence. Sometimes the imagines are
much more nearly related in form than the larvæ,
and at others the reverse happens; whilst again the
case appears also to occur in which only the one
stage (larva) diverges to the extent of specific
difference, the other stage remaining monomorphic
(<i>D. Euphorbiæ</i> and <i>Nicæa</i>).</p>

<p>The agreement in form-relationship appears to
be most complete in genera. In the greater number
of cases the larval and imaginal genera coincide,
not only in the sharpness of their limits, but
also&mdash;as far as one can judge&mdash;in the weight of
their distinctive characters, and therefore in the
amount of their divergence. Of all the systematic
groups, genera show the greatest congruence.</p>

<p>In families there is again an increase of irregularity.
Although larval and imaginal families
generally agree, there are so many exceptions that
the groups would be smaller if they were based
exclusively on the larval structure than if founded
entirely on the imagines (<i>Nymphalidæ</i>, <i>Bombycidæ</i>).</p>

<p>If we turn to the groups of families we find a
considerably increased incongruence; complete
agreement is here again rather the exception, and
it further happens in these cases that it is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
the larvæ which, to a certain extent, remain at a
lower grade, and which form well defined families;
but these can seldom be associated into groups of
a higher order having a common character, as in
the case of the imagines (<i>Rhopalocera</i>).</p>

<p>After having thus collected (so far as I am able)
the facts, we have now to attempt their interpretation,
and from the observed congruence and incongruence
of form-relationship of the two stages to
endeavour to draw a conclusion as to the underlying
causes of the transformations.</p>

<p>It is clear at starting that all cases of incongruence
can only be the expression or the consequence
of a phyletic development which has not been
exactly parallel in the two stages of larva and
imago&mdash;that one stage must have changed either
more rapidly or more slowly than the other. An
“unequal phyletic development” is thus the immediate
cause of incongruence.</p>

<p>Thus, the occurrence of different larvæ in species
of which the imagines have remained alike may be
simply understood as cases in which the imago
only has experienced a change&mdash;has taken a forward
step in phyletic development, whilst the larvæ have
remained behind. If we conceive this one-sided
development to be repeated several times, there
would arise two larval forms as widely different as
those of <i>Deilephila Nicæa</i>, and <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, whilst
the imagines, as is actually the case in these
species, would remain the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span></p>

<p>The more commonly occurring case in which
one stage has a greater form-divergence than the
other, is explicable by the one stage having changed
more frequently or more strongly than the other.</p>

<p>The explanation of the phenomena thus far
lies on the surface, and it is scarcely possible to
advance any other; but why should one stage
become changed more frequently or to a greater
extent than the other? why should one portion
be induced to change more frequently or more
strongly than another? whence come these inducements
to change? These questions bring us
to the main point of inquiry:&mdash;Are the causes
which give rise to these changes internal or external?
Are the latter the result of a phyletic
vital force, or are they only due to the action of
the external conditions of life?</p>

<p>Although an answer to this question will be
found in the preceding essay, I will not support
myself on the results there obtained, but will endeavour
to give another solution of the problem
on fresh grounds. The answer will indeed be the
same as before:&mdash;A phyletic force must be discountenanced,
since in the first place it does not
explain the phenomena, and in the second place
the phenomena can be well explained without its
assumption.</p>

<p>The admission of a phyletic vital force does not
explain the phenomena. The assumption that
there is a transforming power innate in the organism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
indeed agrees quite well with the phenomenon
of congruence, but not with that of incongruence.
Since a large number of cases of the latter depend
upon the fact that the larvæ are more frequently
influenced by causes of change than their imagines,
or <i>vice versâ</i>, how can this be reconciled with such
an internal force? On this assumption would not
each stage of a species be compelled to change, if
not contemporaneously at least successively, with
the same frequency and intensity, by the action of
an innate force? and how by means of the latter
can there ever result a greater form-divergence in
the larvæ than in the imagines?</p>

<p>It is delusive to believe that these unequal
deviations can be explained by assuming that the
phyletic force acts periodically. Granting that it
does so, and that the internal power successively
compels the imago, pupa, and finally the larva to
change, there would then pass a kind of wave of
transformation over the different stages of the
species, as was actually shown above to be the case
in the single larval stages. The only possible way
of explaining the unequal distances between larvæ
and imagines would therefore be to assume that
two allied groups, <i>e.g.</i> species, were not contemporaneously
affected by the wave, so that at a certain
period of time the imago alone of one species
had become changed, whilst in the other species
the wave of transformation had also reached the
larva. In this case the imagines of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
species would thus appear to be more nearly related
than their larvæ.</p>

<p>Now this strained explanation is eminently inapplicable
to varieties, still less to species, and
least of all to higher systematic groups, for the
simple reason that every wave of transformation
may be assumed to be at the most of such strength
as to produce a deviation of form equal to that of
a variety. Were the change resulting from a single
disturbance greater, we should not only find
one-sided varieties, <i>i.e.</i> those belonging to <i>one</i>
stage, but we should also meet as frequently with
one-sided species. If, however, a wave of transformation
can only produce a variety even in the
case of greatest form-divergence, the above hypothetical
uncontemporaneous action of such a wave
in two species could only give rise to such small
differences in the two stages that we could but
designate them as varieties. An accumulation of
the results of the action of several successive
waves passing over the same species could not
happen, because the distance from a neighbouring
species would always become the same in two
stages as soon as <i>one</i> wave had ended its course.
In this manner there could therefore only arise
divergences of the value of varieties, and incongruences
in systematic groups of a higher rank
could not thus be explained.</p>

<p>All explanations of the second form of incongruence
from the point of view of a phyletic force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
can also be shown to be absurd. How can the
fact be explained that larval and imaginal families
by no means always coincide; or that the larvæ
can only be formed into families whilst the
imagines partly form sharply defined groups of a
higher order? How can an internal directive
force within the same organism urge in two quite
distinct directions? If the evolution of a definite
system were designed, and the admission of such
a continually acting power rendered necessary,
why such an incomplete, uncertain, and confused
performance?</p>

<p>I must leave others to answer these questions;
to me a vital force appears to be inadmissible, not
only because we cannot understand the phenomena
by its aid, but above all because it is superfluous
for their explanation. In accordance with general
principles the assumption of an unknown force
can, however, only be made when it is indispensable
to the comprehension of the phenomena.</p>

<p>I believe that the phenomena can be quite well
understood without any such assumption&mdash;both
the phenomena of congruence and incongruence,
in their two forms of unequal divergence and
unequal group-formation.</p>

<p>Let us in the first place admit that there is no
directive force in the organism inciting periodic
change, but that every change is always the consequence
of external conditions, being ultimately
nothing but the reaction&mdash;the response of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
organism to some of the influences proceeding
from the environment; every living form would
in this case remain constant so long as it was not
compelled to change by inciting causes. Such
transforming factors can act directly or indirectly,
<i>i.e.</i> they can produce new changes immediately,
or can bring about a remodelling by the combination,
accumulation, or suppression of individual
variations already present (adaptation by natural
selection). Both forms of this action of external
influences have long been shown to be in actual
operation, so that no new assumption will be made,
but only an attempt to explain the phenomena in
question by the sole action of these known factors
of species formation.</p>

<p>If, in the first instance, we fix our attention
upon that form of incongruence which manifests
itself through unequal divergence of form-relationship,
it will appear prominently that this bears
precise relations to the different systematic groups.
This form of incongruence constitutes the rule in
varieties of the order Lepidoptera, it is of very
frequent occurrence in species, but disappears
almost completely in genera, and entirely in the
case of families and the higher groups. On the
whole, therefore, as we turn to more and more
comprehensive groups, the incongruence diminishes
whilst the congruence increases, until finally the
latter becomes the rule.</p>

<p>Now if congruence presupposes an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
number of transforming impulses, we perceive
that the number of the impulses which have
affected larvæ and imagines agree with one
another the more closely the larger the systematic
groups which are compared together. How can
this be otherwise? The larger the systematic
group the longer the period of time which must
have been necessary for its formation, and the
more numerous the transforming impulses which
must have acted upon it before its formation was
completed.</p>

<p>But if the supposition that the impulse to
change always comes from the environment in no
way favours the idea that such impulses always
affect both stages contemporaneously, and are
equal in number during the same period of time,
there is not, on the other hand, the least ground
for assuming that throughout long periods the
larvæ or the imagines only would have been
affected by such transforming influences. This
could have been inferred from the fact that
varieties frequently depend only upon one stage,
whilst specific differences in larvæ only also occur
occasionally, the imagines remaining alike; but no
single genus is known of which all the species
possess similar larvæ. Within the period of time
during which genera can be formed the transforming
impulses therefore never actually affect
the one stage only, but always influence both.</p>

<p>But if this is the case&mdash;if within the period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
time which is sufficient for the production of
species, the one stage only is but seldom and quite
exceptionally influenced by transforming impulses,
whilst both stages are as a rule affected, although
not with the same frequency, it must necessarily
follow that on the whole, as the period of time
increases, the difference in the number of these
impulses which affect the larva and of those
which affect the imago must continually decrease,
and with this difference the magnitude of the
morphological differences resulting from the transforming
influences must at the same time also
diminish. With the number of the successively
increasing changes the difference in the magnitude
of the change in the two stages would always
relatively diminish until it had quite vanished
from our perception; just in the same manner as
we can distinguish a group of three grains of corn
from one composed of six, but not a heap of 103
grains from one containing 106 grains.</p>

<p>That the small systematic groups must have
required a short period and the large groups a
long period of time for their formation requires no
special proof, but results immediately from the
theory of descent.</p>

<p>All the foregoing considerations would, however,
only hold good if the transforming impulses
were equal in strength, or, not to speak figuratively,
if the changes only occurred in equivalent
portions of the body, <i>i.e.</i> in such portions as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
in which the changes are of the same physiological
and morphological importance to the whole
organism.</p>

<p>Now in the lower systematic groups this is
always the case. Varieties, species, and genera
are always distinguished by only relatively small
differences; deep-seated distinctions do not here
occur, as is implied in the conception of these
categories. The true cause of this is, I believe,
to be found in the circumstance that all changes
take place only by the smallest steps, so that
greater differences can only arise in the course of
longer periods of time, within which a great
number of types (species) can, however, come
into existence, and these would be related by
blood and in form in different degrees, and would
therefore form a systematic group of a higher
rank.</p>

<p>The short periods necessary for the production
of inferior groups, such as genera, would not
result in incongruences if only <i>un</i>typical parts of
the larvæ, such as marking or spines, underwent
change, whilst in the imagines typical parts&mdash;wings
and legs&mdash;became transformed. The
changes which could have occurred in the wings,
&amp;c., during this period of time would have been
much too small to produce any considerable influence
on the other parts of the body by correlation;
and two species of which the larvæ and imagines,
had changed with the same frequency, would show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
a similar amount of divergence between the larvæ
and between the imagines, although on the one
side only <i>un</i>typical parts&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those of no importance
to the whole organization&mdash;and on the
other side typical parts, were affected. The
<i>number</i> of the changes would here alone determine
whether congruence or incongruence occurred
between the two stages.</p>

<p>The case would be quite different if, throughout
a long period of time, in the one stage only
typical and in the other only untypical parts were
subjected to change. In the first case a complete
transformation of the whole structure would occur,
since not only would the typical parts, such as the
wings, undergo a much further and increasing
transformation in the same direction, but these
changes would also lead to secondary alterations.</p>

<p>In this manner, I believe, must be explained
the fact that in the higher groups still greater
form-divergences of the two stages occur; and if
this explanation is correct, the cause of this striking
phenomenon, viz., that incongruence diminishes
from varieties to genera, in which latter it occurs
but exceptionally, whilst in families and in the
higher groups it again continually increases, is
likewise revealed. Up to genera the incongruence
depends entirely upon the one stage having
become changed <i>more frequently</i> than the other;
but in families and groups of families, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
orders Diptera and Hymenoptera, as will be shown
subsequently, in sub-orders and tribes, it depends
upon the <i>importance of the part of the body</i> affected
by the predominant change. In the latter case
the number of changes is of no importance,
because these are so numerous that the difference
vanishes from our perception; but an equal
number of changes, even when very great, may
now produce a much greater or a much smaller
transformation in the entire bodily structure
according as they affect typical or untypical portions,
or according as they keep in the same
direction throughout a long period of time, or
change their direction frequently.</p>

<p>Those unequal form-divergences which occur in
the higher systematic groups a re always associated
with a different formation of groups&mdash;the larvæ
form different systematic groups to the imagines,
so that one of these stages constitutes a higher or
a lower group; or else the groups are of equal
importance in the two stages, but are of unequal
magnitude&mdash;they do not coincide, but the one
overlaps the other.</p>

<p>Incongruences of this last kind appear in certain
cases within families (<i>Nymphalidæ</i>), but I will not
now subject these to closer analysis, because their
causes will appear more clearly when subsequently
considering the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera.
Incongruences of the first kind, however, admit
of a clear explanation in the case of butterflies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
They appear most distinctly in the groups composed
of families.</p>

<p>Nobody has as yet been able to establish the
group <i>Rhopalocera</i> by means of any single character
common to the larvæ; nevertheless, this
group in the imagines is the sharpest and best
defined of the whole order. If we inform the
merest tyro that clubbed antennæ are the chief
character of the butterflies, he will never hesitate
in assigning one of these insects to its correct
group. Such a typical character, common to all
families, is, however, absent in the larvæ; and it
might be correctly said that there were no Rhopalocerous
larvæ, or rather that there were only
larvæ of <i>Equites</i>, <i>Nymphales</i>, and <i>Heliconii</i>. The
larvæ of the various families can be readily separated
by means of characteristic distinctions, and
it would not be difficult for an adept to distinguish
to this extent in single cases a Rhopalocerous
caterpillar as such; but these larvæ possess only
<i>family</i> characters, and not those of a higher
order.</p>

<p>This incongruence partly depends upon the circumstance
that the form-divergence between a
Rhopalocerous and a Heterocerous family is much
greater on the side of the imagines than on that of
the larvæ. Were there but a single family of
butterflies in existence, such as the <i>Equites</i>, we
should be obliged to elevate this to the rank of
a sub-order on the side of the imagines, but not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
that of the larvæ. Such cases actually occur, and
an instance of this kind will be mentioned later in
connection with the Diptera. But this alone does
not explain why, on the side of the imagines, a
whole series of families show the same amount of
morphological divergence from the families of
other groups. There are two things, therefore,
which must here be explained:&mdash;First, why is the
form-divergence between the imagines of the
Rhopalocera and Heterocera greater than that
between their larvæ? and, secondly, why can
the imagines of the Rhopalocera be formed into
one large group by means of common characters
whilst the larvæ cannot?</p>

<p>The answers to both these questions can easily
be given from our present standpoint. As far as
the first question is concerned, this finds its solution
in the fact that the form-divergence always
corresponds exactly with the divergence of function,
<i>i.e.</i> with the divergence in the mode of life.</p>

<p>If we compare a butterfly with a moth there
can be no doubt that the difference in the conditions
of life is far greater on the side of the
imagines than on that of the larvæ. The differences
in the mode of life of the larvæ are on the
whole but very small. They are all vegetable
feeders, requiring large quantities of food, and can
only cease feeding during a short time, for which
reason they never leave their food-plants for long,
and it is of more importance for them to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
firmly attached than to be able to run rapidly. It
is unnecessary for them to seek long for their food,
as they generally find themselves amidst an abundance,
and upon this depends the small development
of their eyes and other organs of sense. On
the whole caterpillars live under very uniform
conditions, although these may vary in manifold
details.</p>

<p>The greatest difference in the mode of life
which occurs amongst Lepidopterous larvæ is
shown by wood feeders. But even these, which
by their constant exclusion from light, the hardness
of their food, their confinement within narrow
hard-walled galleries, and by the peculiar kind of
movement necessitated by these galleries, are so
differently situated in many particulars to those
larvæ which live openly on plants, have not experienced
any general change in the typical conformation
of the body by adaptation to these conditions
of life. These larvæ, which, as has already
been mentioned, belong to the most diverse
families, are more or less colourless and flattened,
and have very strong jaws and small feet; but in
none of them do we find a smaller number of
segments, or any disappearance, or important
transformation of the typical limbs; they all without
exception possess sixteen legs, like the other
larvæ excepting the <i>Geometræ</i>.</p>

<p>Now if even under the most widely diverging
conditions of life adaptation of form is produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
relatively small, and to a certain extent superficial,
changes, we should expect less typical transformations
in the great majority of caterpillars which
live on the exterior of plants or in their softer
parts (most of the Micro-lepidoptera). The great
diversity in the forms of caterpillars depends
essentially upon a different formation of the skin
and its underlying portions. The skin is sometimes
naked, and can then acquire the most diverse
colours, either protective or conspicuous, or it may
develop offensive or defensive markings; in other
cases it may be covered with hairs which sting,
or with spines which prick; certain of its glands
may develop to an enormous size, and acquire
brilliant colours and the power of emitting stinking
secretions (the tentacles of the <i>Papilionidæ</i> and
Cuspidate larvæ); by the development of warts,
angles, humps, &amp;c., any species of caterpillar may
be invested with the most grotesque shape, the
significance of which with respect to the life of the
insect is as yet in most cases by no means clear:
<i>typical portions</i> are not, however, essentially
influenced by these manifold variations. At most
only the form of the individual segments of the
body, and with these the shape of the whole insect,
become changed (onisciform larvæ of <i>Lycænidæ</i>),
but a segment is never suppressed, and even any
considerable lengthening of the legs occurs but
very seldom (<i>Stauropus Fagi</i>).<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span></p>

<p>We may therefore fairly assert that the structure
of larvæ is on the whole remarkably uniform, in
consequence of the uniformity in the conditions of
life. Notwithstanding the great variety of external
aspects, the general structure of caterpillars
does not become changed&mdash;it is only their outward
garb which varies, sometimes in one direction, and
sometimes in another, and which, starting from
inherited characters, becomes adapted to the
various special conditions of life in the best possible
manner.</p>

<p>All this is quite different in the case of the
imagines, where we meet with very important
differences in the conditions of life. The butterflies,
which live under the influence of direct sunlight
and a much higher temperature, and which
are on the wing for a much longer period during
the day, must evidently be differently equipped to
the moths in their motor organs (wings), degree
of hairiness, and in the development of their eyes
and other organs of sense. It is true that we are
not at present in a condition to furnish special
proofs that the individual organs of butterflies are
exactly adapted to a diurnal life, but we may
safely draw this general conclusion from the circumstance
that no butterfly is of nocturnal <span class="locked">habits.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
It cannot be stated in objection that there are
many moths which fly by day. It certainly
appears that no great structural change is necessary
to confer upon a Lepidopteron organized for nocturnal
life the power of also flying by day; but
this proves nothing against the view that the
structure of the butterflies depends upon adaptation
to a diurnal life. Analogous cases are
known to occur in many other groups of animals.
Thus, the decapodous Crustacea are obviously
organized for an aquatic life; but there are some
crabs which take long journeys by land. Fish
appear no less to be exclusively adapted to live in
water; nevertheless the “climbing-perch” (<i>Anabas</i>)
can live for hours on land.</p>

<p>It is not the circumstance that some of the
moths fly by day which is extraordinary and
demands a special explanation, but the reverse
fact just mentioned, that no known butterfly flies
by night. We may conclude from this that the
organization of the latter is not adapted to a
nocturnal life.</p>

<p>If we <span class="locked">assume<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> that the Lepidopterous family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
adapted to a diurnal life gives rise in the course of
time to a nocturnal family, there can be no doubt
but that the transformation of structure would be
far greater on the part of the imagines than on that
of the larvæ. The latter would not remain quite
unchanged&mdash;not because their imagines had taken
to a nocturnal life which for the larva would be
quite immaterial, but because this change could
only occur very gradually in the course of a large
number of generations, and during this long period
the conditions of life would necessarily often change
with respect to the larvæ. It has been shown
above that within the period of time necessary for
the formation of a new species impulses to change
occur on both sides; how much more numerous
therefore must these be in the case of a group of
much higher rank, for the establishment of which
a considerably longer period is required. In the
case assumed, therefore, the larvæ would also
change, but they would suffer much smaller transformations
than the imagines. Whilst in the
latter almost all the typical portions of the body
would undergo deep changes in consequence of the
entirely different conditions of life, the larvæ would
perhaps only change in marking, hairs, bristles, or
other external characters, the typical parts experiencing
only unimportant modifications.</p>

<p>In this manner it can easily be understood why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
the larvæ of a family of <i>Noctuæ</i> do not differ to
a greater extent from those of a family of butterflies
than do the latter from some other Rhopalocerous
family, or why the imagines of a Rhopalocerous and
a Heterocerous family present much greater form-divergences
than their larvæ. At the same time
is therefore explained the unequal value that must
be attributed to any single family of butterflies in
its larvæ and in its imagines. The unequal form-divergences
coincide exactly with the inequalities
in the conditions of life.</p>

<p>When whole families of butterflies show the same
structure in their typical parts (antennæ, wings,
&amp;c.), and, what is of more importance, can be
separated as a systematic group of a higher order
(<i>i.e.</i> as a section or sub-order) from the other
Lepidoptera whilst their larval families do not
appear to be connected by any common character,
the cause of this incongruence lies simply in the
circumstance that the imagines live under some
peculiar conditions which are common to them all,
but which do not recur in other Lepidopterous
groups. Their larvæ live in precisely the same
manner as those of all the other families of Lepidoptera&mdash;they
do not differ in their mode of life
from those of the Heterocerous families to a greater
extent than they do from one another.</p>

<p>We therefore see here a community of form
within the same compass as that in which there is
community in the conditions of life. In all butterflies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
such community is found in their diurnal habits,
and in accordance with this we find that these only,
and not their larvæ, can be formed into a group
having common characters.</p>

<p>In the larvæ also we only find agreement in the
conditions of life within a much wider compass,
viz. within the whole order. Between the limits
of the order Lepidoptera the conditions of life in
the caterpillars are, as has just been shown, on the
whole very uniform, and the structure of the larvæ
accordingly agrees almost exactly in all Lepidopterous
families in every essential, <i>i.e.</i> typical, part.</p>

<p>In this way is explained the hitherto incomprehensible
phenomenon that the sub-ordinal group
<i>Rhopalocera</i> cannot be based on the larvæ, but
that Lepidopterous caterpillars can as a whole be
associated into a higher group (order); they constitute
altogether families and an order, but not
the intermediate group of a sub-order. By this
means we at the same time reply to an objection
that may be raised, viz. that larval forms cannot be
formed into high systematic groups because of
their “low and undeveloped” organization.</p>

<p>To this form of incongruence, viz. to the formation
of systematic groups of unequal value and
magnitude, I must attach the greatest weight with
respect to theoretical considerations. I maintain
that this, as I have already briefly indicated above,
is wholly incompatible with the admission of a
phyletic force. How is it conceivable that such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
power could work in the same organism in two
entirely different directions&mdash;that it should in the
same species lead to the constitution of quite
different systems for the larvæ and for the imagines,
or that it should lead only to the formation of
families in the larvæ and to sub-orders in the
imagines? If an internal force existed which had
a tendency to call into existence certain groups of
animal forms of such a nature that these constituted
one harmonious whole of which the components
bore to one another fixed morphological relationships,
it would certainly have been an easy matter
for such a power to have given to the larvæ of
butterflies some small character which would have
distinguished them as such, and which would in
some measure have impressed them with the stamp
of “<i>Rhopalocera</i>.” Of such a character we find
no trace however; on the contrary, everything goes
to show that the transformations of the organic
world result entirely from external influences.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P2-2-3">III.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Incongruences in other Orders of Insects.</span></span></h4>

<p>Although the order Lepidoptera is for many
reasons especially favourable for an investigation
such as that undertaken in the previous section, it
will nevertheless be advantageous to inquire into
the form-relationships of the two chief stages in
some other orders of metamorphic insects, and to
investigate whether in these cases the formation
of systematic groups also coincides with common
conditions of life.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hymenoptera.</span></h5>

<p>In this order there cannot be the least doubt as
to the form-relationship of the imagines. The
characteristic combination of the pro- and meso-thorax,
the number and venation of the wings, and
the mouth-organs formed for biting and licking, are
found throughout the whole order, and leave no
doubt that the Hymenoptera are well based on
their imaginal characters.</p>

<p>But it is quite different with the larvæ. It may
be boldly asserted that the order would never
have been founded if the larvæ only had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
known. Two distinct larval types here occur,
the one&mdash;caterpillar-like&mdash;possessing a distinct
horny head provided with the typical masticatory
organs of insects, and a body having thirteen segments,
to which, in addition to a variable number
of abdominal legs, there are always attached three
pairs of horny thoracic legs: the other type is
maggot-shaped, without the horny head, and is
entirely destitute of mouth-organs, or at least of
the three pairs of typical insect jaws, and is also
without abdominal and thoracic legs. The number
of segments is extremely variable; the larvæ of
the saw-flies have thirteen besides the head, the
maggot-shaped larvæ of bees possess fourteen
segments altogether, and the gall-flies and ichneumons
only twelve or ten. We should be much
mistaken also if we expected to find connecting
characters in the internal organs. The intestine
is quite different in the two types of larvæ, the
posterior opening being absent in the maggot-like
grubs; at most only the tracheal and nervous
systems show a certain agreement, but this is not
complete.</p>

<p>The order Hymenoptera, precisely speaking and
conceived only morphologically, exists therefore
but in the imagines; in the larvæ there exist only
the caterpillar- and maggot-formed groups. The
former shows a great resemblance to Lepidopterous
larvæ, and in the absence of all knowledge of
the further development it might be attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
unite them with these into one group. The two
certainly differ in certain details of structure in the
mouth-organs and in the number of segments,
abdominal legs, &amp;c., to a sufficient extent to
warrant their being considered as two sub-orders
of one larval order; but they would in any case be
regarded as much more nearly related in form
than the caterpillar- and maggot-like types of the
Hymenopterous larvæ.</p>

<p>Is it not conceivable, however, that the imagines
of the Hymenoptera&mdash;that ichneumons and wasps
may be only accidentally alike, and that they have
in fact arisen from quite distinct ancestral forms,
the one having proceeded with the Lepidopterous
caterpillars from one root, and the other with the
grub-like Dipterous larvæ from another root?</p>

<p>This is certainly not the case; the common
characters are too deep-seated to allow the supposition
that the resemblance is here only superficial.
From the structure of the imagines alone the
common origin of all the Hymenoptera may be
inferred with great probability. This would be
raised into a certainty if we could demonstrate
the phyletic development of the maggot-formed
out of the caterpillar-formed Hymenopterous larvæ
by means of the ontogeny of the former. From
the beautiful investigations of Bütschli on the
embryonic development of <span class="locked">bees<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> we know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
embryo of the grub possesses a complete head,
consisting of four segments and provided with the
three typical pairs of jaws. These head segments
do not subsequently become formed into a true
horny head, but shrivel up; whilst the jaws disappear
with the exception of the first pair, which
are retained in the form of soft processes with
small horny points. We know also that from the
three foremost segments of the embryo the three
typical pairs of legs are developed in the form of
round buds, just as they first appear in all <span class="locked">insects.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span>
These rudimentary limbs undergo complete degeneration
before the birth of the larva, as also do
those of the <span class="locked">whole<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> of the remaining segments,
which, even in this primitive condition, show a
small difference to the three foremost rudimentary
legs.</p>

<p>The grub-like larvæ of the Hymenoptera have
therefore descended from forms which possessed a
horny head with antennæ and three pairs of
gnathites and a 13-segmented body, of which the
three foremost segments were provided with legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
differing somewhat from those of the other segments;
that is to say, they have descended from
larvæ which possessed a structure generally
similar to that of the existing saw-fly larvæ. The
common derivation of all the Hymenoptera from
one source is thus established with <span class="locked">certainty.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span></p>

<p>But upon what does this great inequality in the
form-relationship of the larvæ and imagines depend?
The existing maggot-like grubs are without
doubt much further removed from the active
caterpillar-like larvæ than are the saw-flies from
the Aculeate Hymenoptera. Whilst these two
groups differ only through various modifications
of the typical parts (limbs, &amp;c.), their larvæ are
separable by much deeper-seated distinctions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
limbs of typical importance entirely vanish in the
one group, but in the other attain to complete
development.</p>

<p>In the Hymenoptera there exists therefore a
very considerable incongruence in the systems
based morphologically, <i>i.e.</i> on the pure form-relationships
of the larvæ and of the imagines.
The reason of this is not difficult to find: <i>the
conditions of life differ much less in the case of
the imagines than in that of the larvæ</i>. In the
former the conditions of life are similar in their
broad features. Hymenoptera live chiefly in the
air and fly by day, and in their mode of
obtaining food do not present any considerable
differences. Their larvæ, on the other hand, live
under almost diametrically opposite conditions.
Those of the saw-flies live after the manner of
caterpillars upon or in plants, in both cases their
peculiar locomotion being adapted for the acquisition
and their masticatory organs for the reduction
of food. The larvæ of the other Hymenoptera,
however, do not as a rule require any means of
locomotion for reaching nor any organs of mastication
for swallowing their food, since they are fed in
cells, like the bees and wasps, or grow up in plant
galls of which they suck the juice, or are parasitic
on other insects by whose blood they are nourished.
We can readily comprehend that in the whole of
this last group the legs should disappear, that the
jaws should likewise vanish or should become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
diminished to one pair retained in a much reduced
condition, that the horny casing of the head, the
surface of attachment of the muscles of the jaws,
should consequently be lost, and that even the
segments of the head itself should become more
or less shrivelled up as the organs of sense therein
located became suppressed.</p>

<p>The incongruence manifests itself however in
yet another manner than by the relatively greater
morphological divergence of the larvæ: a different
grouping is possible for the larvæ and for
the imagines. If we divide the Hymenoptera
simply according to the form-relationships of the
imagines, the old division into the two sub-orders
<i>Terebrantia</i> or <i>Ditrocha</i> and <i>Aculeata</i> or <i>Monotrocha</i>
will be the most correct. The distinguishing
characters of a sting or ovipositor and a
one- or two-jointed trochanter are still of the
greatest value. But these two sub-orders do not
by any means correspond with the two types of
larvæ since, in the <i>Terebrantia</i>, there occur
families with both caterpillar-formed and maggot-formed
larvæ.</p>

<p>The cause is to be found in that a portion of
these families possess larvæ which are parasitic in
other insects or in galls, their bodily structure
having by these means become transformed in a
quite different direction. The mode of life of the
imagines is, on the other hand, essentially the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span></p>

<p>We have here therefore another case like that
which we met with among the Rhopalocerous
Lepidoptera, in which the imagines appear to be
capable of being formed into a higher group than
the larvæ, because the former live under conditions
of life which are on the whole similar whilst the
latter live under very divergent conditions.</p>

<p>The old division of the Hymenoptera into two
sub-orders has certainly been abandoned in the later
zoological text-books; they are now divided into
three:&mdash;saw-flies, parasitic, and aculeate Hymenoptera;
but even this arrangement has been
adopted with reference to the different structure
of the larvæ. Whether this system is better than
the older, <i>i.e.</i> whether it better expresses the
<i>genealogical</i> relationship, I will not now stop to
<span class="locked">investigate.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">DIPTERA.</span></h5>

<p>The imagines of the Diptera (<i>genuina</i>), with the
exception of the <i>Aphaniptera</i> and <i>Pupipara</i>, agree
in all their chief characters, such as the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
and structure of the wings, the number and joints
of the legs, the peculiar formation of the thorax
(fusion of the three segments);<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and even the structure
of the mouth organs varies only within narrow
limits. This is in accordance with their mode of
life, which is very uniform in its main features: all
the true Diptera live in the light, moving chiefly
by means of flight, but having also the power of
running; all those which take food in the imago
condition feed upon fluids. Their larvæ, on the
other hand, are formed on two essentially different
types, the one&mdash;which I shall designate as the
gnat-type&mdash;possessing a horny head with eyes,
three pairs of jaws, and long or short antennæ,
together with a 12- or 13-segmented body, which
is never provided with the three typical pairs of
thoracic legs, but frequently has the so-called
abdominal legs on the first and last segments.
The other Dipterous larvæ are maggot-shaped
and without a horny head, or in fact without any
head, since the first segment, the homologue of the
head, can in no case be distinguished through its
being larger than the others; it is on the contrary
much smaller. The typical insect mouth-parts are
entirely absent, being replaced by a variously
formed and quite peculiar arrangement of hooks
situated on the mouth and capable of protrusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
Never more than eleven segments are present
besides the first, which is destitute of eyes; neither
are abdominal legs ever developed.</p>

<p>The mode of life differs very considerably in the
two groups of larvæ. Although the Dipterous
maggots are not as a rule quite incapable of locomotion
like the grubs of the Hymenoptera (bees,
ichneumons), the majority are nevertheless possessed
of but little power of movement in the
food-substance on which they were deposited as
eggs. They do not go in search of food, either
because they are parasitic in other insects in the
same manner as the ichneumons (<i>Tachina</i>), or else
they live on decaying animal or vegetable substances
or amidst large swarms of their prey, like
the larvæ of the <i>Syrphidæ</i> amongst <i>Aphides</i>.
They generally undergo pupation in the same
place as that which they inhabit as larvæ and indeed
in their larval skin which hardens into an
oval pupa-case. Some few leave their feeding
place and pupate after traversing a short distance
(<i>Eristalis</i>).</p>

<p>As in the case of the Hymenoptera the structure
of the larvæ can here also be explained by
peculiarities in their mode of life. Creatures which
live in a mass of food neither require special
organs of locomotion nor specially developed
organs of sense (eyes). They have no use for
the three pairs of jaws since they only feed on
liquid substances, and the hooks within the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
do not serve for the reduction of food but only for
fastening the whole body. With the jaws and
their muscular system there likewise disappears
the necessity for a hard surface of attachment,
<i>i.e.</i> a corneous head.</p>

<p>The mode of life of the larvæ of the gnat-type
is quite different in most points. The
majority, and indeed the most typically formed of
these, have to go in search of their food, whether
they are predaceous, such as the <i>Culicidæ</i> and
many of the other <i>Nemocera</i> (<i>Corethra</i>, <i>Simulium</i>),
or whether they feed on plants, which they in some
cases weave into a protective dwelling tube (certain
species of <i>Chironomus</i>). Many live in water and
move with great rapidity; others bury in the
earth or in vegetable substances; and even those
species which live on fungi sometimes wander
great distances, as in the well-known case of the
“army worm” where thousands of the larvæ of
<i>Sciara Thomæ</i> thus migrate.</p>

<p>Now the two types of larvæ correspond generally
with the two large groups into which, as it
appears to me correctly, the Diptera (<i>genuina</i>) are
as a rule divided. In this respect there is therefore
an equality of form-relationship&mdash;the grouping
is the same, and the incongruence depends
only upon the form-divergence between the two
kinds of larvæ being greater than between the
two kinds of <span class="locked">imagines.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span></p>

<p>That the form-divergence is greater in the
larvæ than in the imagines cannot be doubted;
that this distant form-relationship cannot, however,
be referred to a very remote common origin,
<i>i.e.</i> to a very remote blood-relationship, not only
appears from the existence of transition-forms
between the two sub-orders, but can be demonstrated
here, as in the case of the Hymenoptera,
by the embryonic development of the maggot-like
larvæ.</p>

<p>Seventeen years ago I <span class="locked">showed<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> that the grub-formed
larvæ of the <i>Muscidæ</i> in the embryonic
state possessed a well-developed head with antennæ
and three pairs of jaws, but that later in the course
of the embryonic development a marked reduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
and transformation of these parts takes place,
so that finally the four head segments appear as a
single small ring formed from the coalesced pairs
of maxillæ, whilst the so-called “fore-head” (the
first head segment), together with the mandibles,
becomes transformed into a suctorial-head armed
with hooks and lying within the body. At the
time of writing I drew no conclusion from these
facts with reference to the phyletic development
of these larval forms; nor did Bütschli, six years
later, in the precisely analogous case of the larvæ
of the bees. The inference is, however, so obvious
that it is astonishing that it should not
have been drawn till the present <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the maggot-like
larvæ of insects are not by any means ancient
forms, but are, on the contrary, quite recent, as
first pointed out by Fritz Müller,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and afterwards
by <span class="locked">Packard<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> and <span class="locked">Brauer,<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> and as is maintained in
the latest work by Paul <span class="locked">Mayer<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> on the phylogeny
of insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span></p>

<p>The Dipterous maggots have evidently
descended from a larval form which possessed a
horny head with antennæ and three pairs of jaws,
but which had no appendages to the abdominal
segments; they are therefore ordinary Dipterous
larvæ of the gnat-type which have become modified
in a quite peculiar manner and adapted to a
new mode of life, just as the grubs of the Hymenoptera
are larvæ of the saw-fly type, which have
become similarly transformed, although by no
means in the same manner. The resemblance
between the two types of larva is to a great
extent purely external, and depends upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
process designated “convergence” by Oscar
Schmidt, <i>i.e.</i> upon the adaptation of heterogeneous
animal forms to similar conditions of life. By
adaptation to a life within a mass of fluid nutriment,
the caterpillar-formed larvæ of the Hymenoptera
and the <i>Tipula</i>-like larvæ of the Diptera
have acquired a similar external appearance, and
many similarities in internal structure, or, in brief,
have attained to a considerable degree of form-relationship,
which would certainly have tended
to conceal the wide divergence in blood-relationship
did not the embryological forms on the one
side and the imagines on the other provide us
with an explanation.</p>

<p>It is certainly of great interest that in another
order of insects&mdash;the Coleoptera&mdash;grub-formed
larvæ occur quite irregularly, and their origin can
be here traced to precisely the same conditions of
life as those which have produced the grubs of
bees. I refer to the honey-devouring larvæ of
the <i>Meloïdæ</i> (<i>Meloë</i>, <i>Sitaris</i>, <i>Cantharis</i>). The
case is the more instructive, inasmuch that the
six-legged larval form is not yet relegated to the
development within the egg, but is retained in the
first larval stage. In the <i>second larval stage</i> the
maggot-form is first assumed, although this is certainly
not so well pronounced as in the Diptera
or Hymenoptera, as neither the head nor the
thoracic legs are so completely suppressed as in
these orders. Nevertheless, these parts have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
made a great advance in the process of transformation.</p>

<p>The grub-like larvæ of the Hymenoptera and
Diptera appear to me especially instructive with
reference to the main question of the causes of
transformation. The reply to the questions:
what gives the impetus to change? is this
impetus internal or external? can scarcely be
given with greater clearness than here. If these
larvæ have abandoned their ancestral form and
have acquired a widely divergent structure, arising
not only from suppression but partly also from an
essentially new differentiation (suctorial head of
the <i>Muscidæ</i>), and if these structural changes show
a close adaptation to the existing conditions of
life, from these considerations alone it is difficult
to conceive how such transformations can depend
upon the action of a phyletic force. The latter
must have foreseen that at precisely this or that
fixed period of time the ancestors of these larvæ
would have been placed under conditions of life
which would make it desirable for them to be
modified into the maggot-type. But if at the
same time the imagines are removed in a less
degree from those of the caterpillar-like larvæ,
this divergence being in exact relation with the
deviations in the conditions of life, I at least fail
to see how we can escape the consequence that it
is the external conditions of life which produce
the transformations and induce the organism to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
change. It is to me incomprehensible how one
and the same vital force can in the same individual
induce one stage to become transformed
feebly and the other stage strongly, these transformations
corresponding in extent with the
stronger or weaker deviations in the conditions of
life to which the organism is exposed in the two
stages; to say nothing of the fact that by such
unequal divergences the idea of a perfect system
(creative thought) is completely upset.</p>

<p>Nor can the objection be raised that we are
here only concerned with insignificant changes&mdash;with
nothing more than the arrested development
of single organs and so forth, in brief, only with
those changes which can be ascribed to the action
of the environment.</p>

<p>We are here as little concerned with a mere
suppression of organs through arrested development
as in the case of the Cirripedia; the transformation
and reconstruction of the whole body
goes even much further than in these Crustacea,
although not so conspicuous externally. Where
do we elsewhere find insects having the head
inside a cavity of the body (sectorial head of the
<i>Muscidæ</i>), and of which the foremost segment&mdash;the
physiological representative of the head&mdash;consists
entirely of the coalesced antennæ and
pairs of maxillæ?</p>

<p>The incongruences in the form-relationships
are, however, exceedingly numerous in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
of the Diptera, and a special treatise would be
necessary to discuss them thoroughly. I may
here mention only one case, because the inequality
shows itself in this instance in a quite
opposite sense.</p>

<p>Gerstäcker, who is certainly a competent entomologist,
divides the Diptera into three tribes, viz.
the <i>Diptera genuina</i>, the <i>Pupipara</i>, and the
<i>Aphaniptera</i>. The latter, the fleas, possess in
their divided thoracic segments and in their jointed
labial appendages characters so widely divergent
from those of the true Diptera and of the <i>Pupipara</i>
that Latreille and the English zoologists have
separated them entirely from the Diptera and have
raised them into a separate <span class="locked">order.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> Those who do
not agree in this arrangement, but with Gerstäcker
include the fleas under the Diptera, will nevertheless
admit that the morphological divergence between
the <i>Aphaniptera</i> and the two other tribes is
far greater than that which exists between the
latter. Now the larvæ of the fleas are completely
similar in structure to those of the gnat-type,
since they possess a corneous head with
the typical mouth parts and antennæ and a
13-segmented body devoid of legs. Were we only
acquainted with the larvæ of the fleas we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
rank them with the true Diptera under the sub-order
<i>Nemocera</i>. On first finding such a larva we
should expect to see emerge from the pupa a small
gnat.</p>

<p>While the imagines of the <i>Nemocera</i> and
<i>Aphaniptera</i> thus show but a very remote form-relationship
their larvæ are very closely allied.
Can any one doubt that in this case it is not the
larva but the imago which has diverged to the
greatest extent? Have not the fleas moreover
become adapted to conditions of life widely
different from those of all other Diptera, whilst
their larvæ do not differ in this respect from many
other Dipterous larvæ?</p>

<p>We have here, therefore, another case of unequal
phyletic development, which manifests itself in
the entirely different form-relationship of the larvæ
and the imagines. Thus in this case, as in that of
the Lepidoptera, it is sometimes the larval and at
other times the imaginal stage which has experienced
the greatest transformation, and, as in
the order mentioned, the objection that a phyletic
vital force produces greater and more important
differentiations in the higher imaginal stage than in
the lower or less developed larval stage, is equally
ineffectual.</p>

<p>If, however, it be asked whether the unequal
phyletic development depends in this case upon an
unequal number of transforming impulses which
the two stages may have experienced during an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
equal period of time, this must be decidedly
answered in the negative. The unequal development
obviously depends in this case, as in the
higher systematic groups of the Lepidoptera, upon
the unequal value of the parts affected by the
changes. These parts are on the one side of
small importance, and on the other side of great
importance, to the whole structure of the insect.
This is shown in the last-mentioned case of the
fleas, where, of the typical parts of the body, only
the wings have become rudimentary, whilst the
antennæ, mouth-parts, and legs, and even the form
and mode of segmentation (free thoracic segments),
must have suffered most important modifications;
their larvæ, on the other hand, can have experienced
only unimportant changes, since they
still agree in all typical parts with those of the
gnat-type.</p>

<p>Although therefore in this and in similar cases a
greater number of transforming impulses may well
have occurred on the one side than on the other&mdash;and
it is indeed highly probable that this number
has not been absolutely the same&mdash;nevertheless
the chief cause of the striking incongruence is not
to be found therein, but rather in the <i>strength</i> of
the transforming impulses, if I may be permitted
to employ this figure, or, more precisely expressed,
in the importance of the parts which become
changed and at the same time in the amount of
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span></p>

<p>In this conclusion there is implied as it appears
to me an important theoretical result which tells
further against the efficacy of a phyletic force.</p>

<p>If the so-called “typical parts” of an animal
disappear completely through the action of the
environment only, and still further, if these parts
can become so entirely modified as to give rise to
quite new and again typical structures (suctorial
head of the <i>Muscidæ</i>) without the typical parts of
the other stage of the same individual being
thereby modified and transformed into a new type
of structure, how can we maintain a distinction
between typical and non-typical parts with respect
to their origin? But if a difference exists with
respect only to the physiological importance of
such parts, <i>i.e.</i> their importance for the equilibrium
of the whole organization, while, with reference to
transformation and suppression, exactly the same
influences appear to be effective as those which
bring about a change in or a disappearance of the
so-called adventitious parts, where is there left any
scope for the operation of the supposed phyletic
force? What right have we to assume that the
typical structures arise by the action of a vital
force? Nevertheless this is the final refuge of
those who are bound to admit that a great number
of parts or characters of an animal can become
changed, suppressed, or even produced by the
action of the environment.</p>

<h4 id="P2-2-4">IV.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Summary and Conclusion.</span></span></h4>

<p>The question heading the second section of this
essay must at the conclusion of the investigation
be answered in the negative. The form-relationship
of the larvæ does not always coincide with
that of the imagines, or, in other words, a system
based entirely on the morphology of the larvæ does
not always coincide with that founded entirely
on the morphology of the imagines.</p>

<p>Two kinds of incongruence here present themselves.
The first arises from the different amount
of divergence between two systematic groups in
the larvæ and in the imagines, these groups being
of equal extent. The second form of incongruence
consists essentially in that the two stages
form systematic groups of different extents, either
the one stage constituting a group of a higher
order than the other and therefore forming a
group of unequal value, or else the two stages
form groups of equal systematic value, these
groups, however, not coinciding in extent, but the
one overlapping the other.</p>

<p>This second form of incongruence is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
frequently connected with the first kind, and is
mostly the direct consequence of the latter.</p>

<p>The cause of the incongruences is to be found
in unequal phyletic development, either the one
stage within the same period of time having been
influenced by a greater number of transforming impulses
than the other, or else these impulses
have been different in strength, <i>i.e.</i> have affected
parts of greater or less physiological value, or
have influenced parts of equal value with unequal
strength.</p>

<p>In all these cases in which there are deep-rooted
form-differences, it can be shown that these
correspond exactly with inequalities in the conditions
of life, this correspondence being in two
directions, viz. in strength and in extent: the
former determines the <i>degree</i> of form-difference,
the latter its <i>extent</i> throughout a larger or smaller
group of species.</p>

<p>The different forms of incongruence are manifested
in the following <span class="locked">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) Different amount of form-divergence
between the larvæ on the one side and the
imagines on the other. Among the Lepidoptera
this is found most frequently in varieties and
species, and there is evidence to show that in this
case the one stage has been affected by transforming
influences, either alone (varieties), or at
any rate to a greater extent (species). In the
last case it can be shown in many ways that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
stage (the larva) has actually remained at an older
phyletic grade (<i>Deilephila</i> species). Incongruences
of this kind depending entirely upon the
more frequent action of transforming impulses can
only become observable in the smaller systematic
groups, in the larger they elude comparative examination.
In the higher groups unequal form-divergence
may be produced by the transforming
impulses affecting parts of unequal physiological
and morphological value, or by their influencing
parts of equal value in different degrees. All
effects of this kind can, however, only become
manifest after a long-continued accumulation of
single changes, <i>i.e.</i> only in those systematic
groups which require a long period of time for
their formation. By this means we can completely
explain why the incongruences of form-divergence
continually diminish from varieties to genera, and
then increase again from genera upwards through
families, tribes, and sub-orders: the first diminishing
incongruence depends upon an <i>unequal
number</i> of transforming impulses, the latter increasing
incongruence depends upon the <i>unequal
power</i> of these impulses.</p>

<p>Cases of the second kind are found among
the Lepidopterous families, and especially in the
higher groups (<i>Rhopalocera</i> and <i>Heterocera</i>), and
appear still more striking in the higher groups of
the Hymenoptera and Diptera. Thus the caterpillar
shaped and maggot-formed larvæ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
Hymenoptera differ from one another to a much
greater extent than their imagines, since the
latter have experienced a complete transformation
of typical parts; whilst in the caterpillar-formed
larvæ these parts vary only within moderate limits.
Similarly in the case of the Diptera, of which the
gnat-like larvæ diverge more widely from those of
the grub type than do the gnats from the true
flies. On the other hand the divergence between
the imagines of the fleas and gnats is considerably
greater than that between their larvæ&mdash;indeed
the larvæ of the fleas would have to be ranked as
a family of the sub-order of the gnat-like larvæ
if we wished to carry out a larval classification.
By this it is also made evident that these unequal
divergences, when they occur in the higher
systematic groups, always induce at the same
time the second form of incongruence&mdash;that of the
formation of unequal systematic groups.</p>

<p>In general whenever such unequal divergences
occur in the higher groups they run parallel with
a strong deviation in the conditions of life. If
these differ more strongly on the side of the
larvæ, we find that the structure of the latter likewise
diverges the more widely, and that their
form-relationship is in consequence made more
remote (saw-flies and ichneumons, gnats and flies);
if, on the other hand, the difference in the conditions
of life is greater on the side of the
imagines, we find among the latter the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
morphological divergence (butterflies and moths,
gnats and fleas).</p>

<p>(2.) The second chief form of incongruence
consists in the formation of different systematic
groups by the larvæ and the imagines, if the latter
are grouped simply according to their form-relationship
without reference to their genetic
affinities. This incongruence again shows itself
in two forms&mdash;in the formation of groups of
unequal value, and the formation of groups equal
in value but unequal in extent, <i>i.e.</i> of overlapping
instead of coinciding groups.</p>

<p>Of these two forms the first arises as the direct
result of a different amount of divergence. Thus
the larvæ of the fleas, on account of their small
divergence from those of the gnats, could only
lay claim to the rank of a <i>family</i>, whilst their
imagines are separated from the gnats by such a
wide form-divergence that they are correctly
ranked as a distinct <i>tribe</i> or <i>sub-order</i>.</p>

<p>The inequalities in the lowest groups, varieties,
can be regarded in a precisely similar manner. If
the larva of a species has become split up into
two local forms, but not the imago, each of the
two larval forms possesses only the rank of a
<i>variety</i>, whilst the imaginal form has the value of a
<i>species</i>.</p>

<p>Less simple are the causes of the phenomenon
that in the one stage the lower groups can be
combined into one of higher rank, whilst the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
stage does not attain to this high rank. Such a
condition appears especially complicated when the
two stages can again be formed into groups of a
still higher rank.</p>

<p>This is the case in the tribe <i>Rhopalocera</i>, which
is founded on the imagines alone, the larvæ forming
only families of butterflies. Both stages can
however be again combined into the highest
systematic group of the Lepidoptera.</p>

<p>In this case also the difference in the value of
the systematic groups formed by the two stages
corresponds precisely with the difference in the
conditions of life. This appears very distinctly
when there are several sub-groups on each side,
and not when, as in the fleas, only one family is
present as a tribe on the one side and on the
other as a family. Thus in the butterflies, on the
one side there are numerous families combined
into the higher rank of a sub-order (imagines),
whilst on the other side (larvæ) a group of the
same extent cannot be formed. In this instance
it can be distinctly shown that the combination of
the families into a group of a higher order, as is
possible on the side of the imagines, corresponds
exactly with the limits in which the conditions of
life deviate from those of other Lepidopterous
families. The group of butterflies corresponds
with an equally large circle of uniform conditions
of life, whilst a similar uniformity is wanting on
the side of the larvæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span></p>

<p>The second kind of unequal group formation
arises from the circumstance that groups of equal
value can be formed from the two stages, but
these groups do not possess the same limits&mdash;they
overlap, and only coincide in part.</p>

<p>This is most clearly seen in the order Hymenoptera,
in which both larvæ and imagines form
two well-defined morphological sub-orders, but
in such a manner that the one larval form not
only prevails throughout the whole of the one
sub-order of the imagines, but also extends beyond
and spreads over a great portion of the other
imaginal sub-order.</p>

<p>Here again the dependence of this phenomenon
upon the influence of the environment is very
distinct, since it can be demonstrated (by the
embryology of bees) that the one form of larva&mdash;the
maggot-type&mdash;although the structure now
diverges so widely, has been developed from the
other form, and that it must have arisen by adaptation
to certain widely divergent conditions of life.</p>

<p>This form of incongruence is always connected
with unequal divergence between the two stages of
the one systematic group&mdash;in this case the <i>Terebrantia</i>.
The larvæ of this imaginal group partly
possess caterpillar-like (<i>Phytospheces</i>) and partly
maggot-formed (<i>Entomospheces</i>) larvæ, and differ
from one another to a considerably greater extent
than the saw-flies from the <span class="locked">ichneumons.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
final cause of the incongruence lies therefore in this
case also in the fact that one stage has suffered
stronger changes than the other, so that a deeper
division of the group has occurred in the former
than in the latter.</p>

<p>The analogous incongruences in single families
of the Lepidoptera may have arisen in a similar
manner, as has already been more clearly shown
above; only in these cases we are as yet unable
to prove in detail that the larval structure has
become more strongly changed through special
external conditions of life than that of the
imagines.</p>

<p>In the smallest systematic group&mdash;varieties, it
has been possible to furnish some proof of this.
The one-sided change here depends in part upon
the <i>direct action</i> of external influences (seasonal
dimorphism, climatic variation), and it can be shown
that these influences (temperature) acted only on
the one stage, and accordingly induced change in
this alone whilst the other stage remained unaltered.</p>

<p>It has now been shown&mdash;not indeed in every individual
case, but for each of the different kinds of
incongruence of form-relationship&mdash;that there is an
exact parallelism corresponding throughout with
the incongruence in the conditions of life.
Wherever the forms diverge more widely in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
stage than in the other we also find more widely
divergent conditions of life; wherever the morphological
systemy of one stage fails to coincide
with that of the other&mdash;whether in the extent
or in the value of the groups&mdash;the conditions of
life in that stage also diverge, either more widely
or at the same time within other limits; whenever
a morphological group can be constructed from
one stage but not from the other, we find that this
stage alone is submitted to certain common conditions
of life which fail in the other stage.</p>

<p>The law that the divergence in form always
corresponds exactly with the divergence in the
conditions of <span class="locked">life<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span> has accordingly received confirmation
in all cases where we have been able to
pronounce judgment. Unequal form-divergences
correspond precisely with unequal divergence in
the conditions of life, and community of form
appears within exactly the same limits as community
in the conditions of life.</p>

<p>These investigations may thus be concluded
with the following law:&mdash;In types of similar origin,
<i>i.e.</i> having the same blood-relationship, the degree
of morphological relationship corresponds exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
with the degree of difference in the conditions of
life in the two stages.</p>

<p>With respect to the question as to the final
cause of transformation this result is certainly of
the greatest importance.</p>

<p>The interdependence of structure and function
has often been insisted upon, but so long as this
has reference only to the agreement of each particular
form with some special mode of life, this
harmony could still be regarded as the result of a
directive power; but when in metamorphic forms
we not only see a double agreement between structure
and function, but also that the transformation
of the form occurs in the two chief developmental
stages in successive steps at unequal rates and with
unequal strength and rhythm, we must&mdash;at least
so it appears to me&mdash;abandon the idea of an inherent
transforming force; and this becomes the
more necessary when, by means of the opposite and
extremely simple assumption that transformations
result entirely from the response of the organism
to the actions of the environment, all the phenomena&mdash;so
far as our knowledge of facts at
present extends&mdash;can be satisfactorily explained.
A power compelling transformation, <i>i.e.</i> a phyletic
vital force, must be abandoned, on the double
ground that it is incapable of explaining the
phenomena (incongruence and unequal phyletic
development), and further because it is superfluous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span></p>

<p>Against the latter half of this argument there
can at most be raised but the one objection that
the phenomena of transformation are not completely
represented by the cases here analysed.
In so far as this signifies that the whole organic
world, animal and vegetable, has not been comprised
within the investigation this objection is
quite valid. The question may be raised as to the
limit to which we may venture to extend the results
obtained from one small group of forms.
I shall return to this question in the last essay.</p>

<p>But if by this objection it is meant that the
restricted field of the investigation enables us to
actually analyse only a portion of the occurring
<span class="locked">transformations,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> and indeed only those cases, the
dependence of which upon the external conditions
of life would be generally admitted, I will not
let pass the opportunity of once more pointing out
at the conclusion of the present essay that the
incongruences shown to exist by no means depend
only upon those more superficial characters
the remodelling of which in accordance with the
external conditions of life may be most easily discerned
and is most difficult to deny, but that in
certain cases (maggot-like Dipterous larvæ) it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
precisely the “typical” parts which become
partly suppressed and partly converted into an
entirely new structure. From the ancient typical
appendages there have here arisen new structures,
which again have every right to be considered as
typical. This transformation is not to be compared
with that experienced by the swimming appendages
of the <i>Nauplius</i>-like ancestor of an <i>Apus</i>
or <i>Branchipus</i> which have become mandibulate,
nor with the transformation which the anterior
limbs must have gone through in the reptilian
ancestors of birds. The changes in question
(Dipterous larvæ) go still further and are more
profound. I lay great emphasis upon this because
we have here one of the few cases which show
that typical parts are quite as dependent upon the
environment as untypical structures, and that the
former are not only able to become adapted to
external conditions by small modifications&mdash;as
shown in a most striking manner by the transformations
of the appendages in the Crustacea and
Vertebrata&mdash;but that these parts can become
modelled on an entirely new type which, when
perfected, gives no means of divining its mode of
origin. I may here repeat a former statement:&mdash;With
reference to the causes of their origination
we have no grounds for drawing a distinction between
typical and untypical structures.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned in concluding that quite
analogous although less sharply defined results are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
arrived at if, instead of fixing our attention upon
the different stages of a systematic group in their
phyletic development, we only compare the different
functional parts (organs in the wide sense) of
the organisms.</p>

<p>A complete parallel can be drawn between the
two classes of developmental phenomena. From
the very different systematic values attached by
taxonomists to this or that organ in a group of
animals, it may be concluded that the individual
parts of an organism are to a certain extent independent,
and that each can vary independently,
when affected either entirely alone or in a preponderating
degree by transforming impulses, without
all the other parts of the organism likewise suffering
transformation, or at least without their becoming
modified in an equal degree. Did all the
parts and organs in two groups of animals diverge
from each other to the same extent, the systematic
value of such parts would be perfectly equal; we
should, for example, be able to distinguish and
characterize two genera of the family of mice by
their kidneys, their liver, their salivary glands, or
by the histological structure of their hair or
muscles, or even by differences in their myology,
&amp;c. equally as well as by their teeth, length of
toes, &amp;c. It is true that such a diagnosis has yet
to be attempted; but it may safely be predicted
that it would not succeed. Judging from all the
facts at present before us, the individual parts&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
especially those connected in their physiological
action, <i>i.e.</i> the system of organs&mdash;do not keep pace
with reference to the modifications which the
species undergoes in the course of time; at one
period one system and at another period some
other system of organs advances while the others
remain behind.</p>

<p>This corresponds exactly with the result already
deduced from the unparallel development of the
independent ontogenetic stages. If the inequality
in the phyletic development is more sharply pronounced
in this than in the last class of cases, this
can be explained by the greater degree of correlation
which exists between the individual systems
of organs in any single organism as compared
with that existing between the ontogenetic stages,
which, although developed from one another, are
nevertheless almost completely independent. We
should have expected <i>à priori</i> that a strong correlation
would have here existed, but as a matter of
fact this is not the case, or is so only in a very
small degree.</p>

<p>Just as in the stages of metamorphosis the inequality
of phyletic development becomes the
more obliterated the more distant and comprehensive,
or, in other words, the greater the period of
existence of the groups which we compare, so does
the unequal divergence of the systems of organs
become obliterated as we bring into comparison
larger and larger systematic groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span></p>

<p>It is not inconceivable&mdash;although a clear proof
of this is certainly as yet wanting&mdash;that a variety
of the ancestral species would differ only in one
single character, such as hairiness, colour, or
marking, and such instances would thus agree
precisely with the foregoing cases in which only
the caterpillar or the butterfly formed a variety.
All the more profound modifications however&mdash;such
for instance as those which determine the difference
between two species&mdash;are never limited to
one character, but always affect several, this being
explicable by correlation, which, as Darwin has
shown in the case of dogs, may cause modifications
in the skull of those breeds having hanging ears in
consequence of this last character alone. It must
be admitted however that one organ only would
be originally affected by a modifying influence.
Thus, I am acquainted with two species of a
genus of Daphniacea which are so closely allied
that they can only be distinguished from one
another by a close comparison of individual details.
But whilst most of the external and internal
organs are almost identical in the two
species the sperm-cells of the males differ in a
most striking manner, in one species resembling
an Australian boomerang in form and in the other
being spherical! An analogous instance is furnished
by <i>Daphnia Pulex</i> and <i>D. Magna</i>, two species
which were for a long time confounded. Nearly
all the parts of the body are here exactly alike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
but the antennæ of the males differ to a remarkable
extent, as was first correctly shown by
Leydig.</p>

<p>Similarly in the case of genera there may be
observed an incongruence of such a kind that individual
parts of the body may deviate to a
greater or to a less extent than the corresponding
parts in an allied genus. If, for instance, we compare
a species of the genus of Daphniacea, <i>Sida</i>, with
a species of the nearly allied genus <i>Daphnella</i>, we
find that all the external and internal organs are in
some measure dissimilar&mdash;nevertheless certain of
these parts deviate to an especially large extent,
and have without question become far more transformed
than the others. This is the case, for
example, with the antennæ and the male sexual
organs. The latter, in <i>Daphnella</i>, open out at the
sides of the posterior part of the body as long,
boot-shaped generative organs, and in <i>Sida</i> as
small papillæ on the ventral side of this region of
the body. If again we compare <i>Daphnella</i> with
the nearly allied genus <i>Latona</i>, it will be found that
no part in the one is exactly similar to the
corresponding part in the other genus, whilst certain
organs differ more widely than others. This
is the case for instance with the oar-like appendages
which in <i>Latona</i> are triramous, but in
<i>Daphnella</i>, as in almost all the other Daphniacea,
only biramous.</p>

<p>In families the estimation of the form-divergence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
of the systems of organs and parts of the body
becomes difficult and uncertain: still it may
safely be asserted that the two Cladocerous
families <i>Polyphemidæ</i> and <i>Daphniidæ</i> differ much
less from one another in the structure of their oar-like
appendages than in that of their other parts,
such as the head, shell, legs, or abdominal
segments. In systematic groups of a still higher
order, <i>i.e.</i> in orders, and still more in classes, we
might be inclined to consider that all the organs
had become modified to an equally great extent.
Nevertheless it cannot be conclusively said that
the kidneys of a bird differ from those of a
mammal to the same extent as do the feathers
from mammalian hair, since we cannot estimate
the differences between quite heterogeneous things&mdash;it
can only be stated that both differ greatly.
Here also the facts are not such as would have
been expected if transformation was the result of
an internal developmental force; no uniform
modification of <i>all</i> parts takes place, but first one
part varies (variety) and then others (species), and,
on the whole, as the systematic divergence increases
all parts become more and more affected
by the transformation and all tend continually to
appear changed to an equal extent. This is precisely
what would be expected if the transforming
impulses came from the environment. An equalization
of the differences caused by transformation
must be produced in two ways; first by correlation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
since nearly every primary transformation must
entail one or more secondary changes, and
secondly because, as the period of time increases,
more numerous parts of the body must become
influenced by primary transforming factors.</p>

<p>A tempting theme is here also offered by
attempting to trace the inequality of phyletic
development to dissimilar external influences, and
by demonstrating that individual organs have as a
rule become modified in proportion to the divergence
in the conditions of life by which they have
been influenced, this action, during a given period
of time, having been more frequent in the case of
one organ than in that of the others, or, in brief,
by showing the connection between the causes and
effects of transformation.</p>

<p>It would be quite premature, however, to undertake
such a labour at present, since it will be long
before physiology is able to account for the fine
distinctions shown by morphology, and further because
we have as yet no insight into those internal
adjustments of the organism which would enable us
<i>à priori</i> to deduce definite secondary changes from
a given primary transformation. But so long as
this is impossible we have no means of distinguishing
correlative changes from the primary modifications
producing them, unless they happen to arise
under our observation.</p>

&amp;c., of Caterpillars.</span></span></h4>

<p><i>Ontogeny of the Noctua larvæ.</i>&mdash;References have already
been given in a previous note (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_67">67</a>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_166">166</a>) to observations
on the number of legs and geometer-like habits of
certain <i>Noctua</i>-larvæ when newly hatched. This interesting
fact in the development of these insects furnishes
a most instructive application of the principle of
ontogeny to the determination of the true affinities, <i>i.e.</i>
the blood-relationship of certain groups of Lepidoptera.
While the foregoing portions of this work have been in
course of preparation for the press, some additional
observations on this subject have been published, and I
may take the present opportunity of pointing out their
systematic bearing&mdash;not, indeed, with a view to settling
definitively the positions of the groups in question, as
our knowledge is still somewhat scanty&mdash;but with the
object of stimulating further investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. H. T. Stainton has lately recorded the fact that
the young larva of <i>Triphæna Pronuba</i> is a semi-looper
(Ent. Mo. Mag. vol. xvii. p. 135); and in a recently
published life-history of <i>Euclidia Glyphica</i> (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 210)
Mr. G. T. Porritt states that this caterpillar is a true
looper when young, but becomes a semi-looper when
adult. To these facts Mr. R. F. Logan adds (<i>Ibid.</i>
p. 237) that “nearly all the larvæ of the <i>Trifidæ</i> are
semi-loopers when first hatched.” The <i>Cymatophoræ</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
appear to be an exception, but Mr. Logan points out
that this genus is altogether aberrant, and seems to be
allied to the <i>Tortricidæ</i>. Summing up the results of
these and the observations previously referred to, it will
be seen that this developmental character has now been
established in the case of species belonging to the
following families of the section <i>Genuinæ</i>:&mdash;<i>Leucaniidæ</i>,
<i>Apameidæ</i>, <i>Caradrinidæ</i>, <i>Noctuidæ</i>, <i>Orthosiidæ</i>, <i>Hadenidæ</i>,
and <i>Xylinidæ</i>, as well as the other <i>Trifidæ</i> (excepting
<i>Cymatophora</i>).<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The larvæ of the <i>Minores</i> and <i>Quadrifidæ</i>
are as a rule semi-loopers when adult and may be
true loopers when young, although further observations
on this point are wanted. These facts point to the conclusion
that the <i>Noctuæ</i> as a whole are phyletically younger
than the <i>Geometræ</i>, whilst the <i>Genuinæ</i> and <i>Bombyciformes</i>
have further advanced in phyletic development
than the <i>Minores</i> and <i>Quadrifidæ</i>. The last two sections
are therefore the most closely related to the <i>Geometræ</i>, as
correctly shown by the arrangement given in Stainton’s
“Manual;” whilst that adopted in Doubleday’s “Synonymic
List,” where the <i>Geometræ</i> precede the <i>Noctuæ</i>,
is most probably erroneous.</p>

<p><i>Additional descriptions of Sphinx-larvæ.</i>&mdash;In the foregoing
essay on “The Origin of the Markings of Caterpillars,”
Dr. Weismann has paid special attention to the
larvæ of the <i>Sphingidæ</i> and has utilized for this purpose,
in addition to his own studies of the ontogeny of many
European species, the figures in the chief works dealing
with this family published down to the time of appearance
of his essay (1876).<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> In order to amplify this part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
of the subject I have added references to more recent
descriptions and figures of Sphinx-larvæ published by
Burmeister and A. G. Butler, and I have endeavoured in
these cases to refer the caterpillars as far as possible to
their correct position in the respective groups founded
on the ontogeny and phylogeny of their allies. It is,
however, obvious that for the purposes of this work
figures or descriptions of adult larvæ are of but little
value, except for the comparative morphology of the
markings; and even this branch of the subject only
becomes of true biological importance when viewed in
the light of ontogeny. As our knowledge of the latter
still remains most incomplete in the case of exotic
species, it would be at present premature to attempt to
draw up any genealogy of the whole family, and I will
here only extend the subject by adding some few descriptions
of species which are interesting as having been
made from the observations of field-naturalists, and which
contain remarks on the natural history of the insects.</p>

<p>Mr. C. V. Riley in his “Second Annual Report on
the Noxious, Beneficial, and other Insects of the State of
Missouri, 1870,” gives figures and describes the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
stages and adult forms of certain grape-vine feeding
larvæ of the sub-family <i>Chærocampinæ</i>. The full-grown
larva of <i>Philampelus Achemon</i>, Drury, “measures about
3½ inches when crawling, which operation is effected by
a series of sudden jerks. The third segment is the
largest, the second but half its size, and the first still
smaller, and when at rest the two last-mentioned
segments are partly withdrawn into the third.... The
young larva is green, with a long slender reddish horn
rising from the eleventh segment and curving over the
back.” Mr. Riley then states that full grown specimens
are sometimes found as green as the younger ones, but
“they more generally assume a pale straw or reddish-brown
colour, and the long recurved horn is invariably
replaced by a highly polished lenticular tubercle.” The
specimen figured was the pale straw variety, this colour
deepening at the sides, and finally merging into a rich
brown. The markings appear to consist of an interrupted
brown dorsal line, a continuous subdorsal line of the
same colour, and six oblique scalloped white bars along
the side. Whether the colour and marking is adapted
to the vine, as is the case with the two varieties of the
dimorphic <i>Chærocampa Capensis</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), is not stated.
The larva of <i>Philampelus Satellitia</i>, Linn., when newly
hatched, and for some time afterwards is “green with a
tinge of pink along the sides, and with an immensely
long straight pink horn at the tail. This horn soon begins
to shorten, and finally curls round like a dog’s tail.” The
colour of the insect changes to a reddish-brown as it grows
older, and the caudal horn is entirely lost at the third moult.
The chief markings appear to be five oblique cream-yellow
patches with a black annulation on segments 6&ndash;10, and
a pale subdorsal line. The caterpillar crawls by a
series of sudden jerks, and often flings its “head savagely
from side to side when alarmed.” “When at rest, it
draws back the fore part of the body and retracts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
head and first two joints into the third.” Two points
in connection with these species are of interest with
respect to the present investigations. The green colour
and the possession of a long caudal horn when young
shows that these larvæ, like those of <i>Chærocampa Elpenor</i>
(p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_178">178</a>), <i>C. Porcellus</i> (p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_184">184</a>), and <i>Philampelus Labruscæ</i>
(p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_195">195</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_83">note</a>), are descended from ancestors which possessed
these characters in the adult <span class="locked">state.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> The next
point of interest is the attitude of alarm assumed by these
larvæ, and effected by withdrawing the head and two
front segments into the <span class="locked">third.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> The importance of this
in connection with the similar habit of ocellated species
will be seen on reading the remarks on page 367 bearing
upon the initial stages of eye-spots. The other species
figured by Mr. Riley are <i>Chærocampa Pampinatrix</i>,
Smith and Abbot, and <i>Thyreus Abboti</i>, Swains. The
latter has already been referred to (p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_256">256</a>).</p>

<p>In a paper “On a Collection of Lepidoptera from
Candahar” (Proc. Zoo. Soc., May 4th, 1880), Mr. A. G.
Butler has described and figured, from materials furnished
to him by Major Howland Roberts, the larvæ of
three species of <i>Sphingidæ</i>. <i>Chærocampa Cretica</i>, Boisd.,
feeds on vine; out of 100 specimens examined, there
was not one black variety, while in another closely allied
species, found at Jutogh and Kashmir, the larva is stated
to be as often black as green. The general colour of
the caterpillar harmonizes with that of the underside of
the vine leaves; it possesses a thread-like dorsal, and a
pale yellow subdorsal line; also “a subdorsal row of
eye-spots, each consisting of a green patch in a yellow
oval, the first spot on the fifth segment being the largest
and most distinct, those on each following segment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
becoming smaller, more flattened, and less distinct, till
lost on the twelfth segment, sometimes becoming
indistinct after the seventh or eighth segment; these
spots are only distinct as eye-spots on the fifth and
sixth segments, that on the sixth being flatter than that
on the fifth, those on the remaining segments appearing
like dashes while the larvæ is green, but more like eyes
on its changing colour when full fed.” The change here
alluded to is the dark-brown coloration so generally
assumed by green Sphinx-larvæ previous to pupation,
and which, as I have stated elsewhere (Proc. Zoo. Soc.,
1873, p. 155), is probably an adaptation advantageous
to such larvæ when crawling over the ground in search
of a suitable place of concealment. Making the necessary
correction for the different mode of counting the
segments, it will be seen that the primary ocelli of this
species are in the same position as those of the other
species of this genus as described in a previous part of
this essay, and that it belongs to the second phyletic
group treated of at p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_193">193</a>. The interesting fact that
this species does not display dimorphism, whilst the
closely allied form from Kashmir is dimorphic, shows
that in the present species the process of double adaptation
has not taken place; and this will probably be found
to be connected with the habits of life, <i>i.e.</i> the insect
being well adapted to the colour of its food-plant may
not conceal itself on the ground by day. The caterpillar
of <i>Deilephila Robertsi</i>, Butl., is found at Candahar on a
species of <i>Euphorbia</i> growing on the rocky hills, and is
so abundant that at the end of May every plant with any
leaves left on it had several larvæ feeding upon it. “The
larvæ are very beautiful and conspicuous, and are very
different in colouring according to their different stages
of growth.” The general colour is black with white
dots and spots; a subdorsal row of large roundish spots,
one on each segment, either white, yellow, orange or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
red; dorsal stripe variable in colour, and sometimes
only partially present or altogether absent. “At the
end of May most of the larvæ found presented a different
appearance; the black disappears more or less, and with
it many of the small white spots. In some cases the
black only remains as a ring round the larger white
spots; the ground-colour therefore becomes yellowish-green
or yellow, varying very considerably.” The larva
does not change colour previous to pupation. This
species, according to the outline figure given (<i>loc. cit.</i>,
Pl. XXXIX., Fig. 9), appears to belong to the first of
Dr. Weismann’s groups, comprising <i>D. Euphorbiæ</i>,
<i>D. Dahlii</i> and <i>D. Nicæa</i> (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_199">199</a>), and is therefore in
the seventh phyletic stage of development (p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_224">224</a>). From
the recorded habits it seems most probable that the
colours and markings of this caterpillar are signals of
distastefulness. It is much to be regretted that Major
Roberts has not increased the value of his description of
this species by adding some observations or experiments
bearing on this point. <i>Eusmerinthus Kindermanni</i>,
Lederer, feeds on willow. “General colour green,
covered with minute white dots and seven long pale yellow
oblique lateral bands. (The ground-colour is
the same as the willow-leaves on which the larva feeds,
the yellow stripes the same as the leaf-stalks, and the
head and true legs like the younger branches).” As no
subdorsal line is mentioned or figured, this species must
be regarded as belonging to the third stage of phyletic
development (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_242">242</a>).</p>

<p>I have recently had an opportunity of inspecting a large
number of drawings of Sphinx-larvæ in the possession
of Mr. F. Moore, and of those species not mentioned in
the previous portions of this work the following may be
noticed:&mdash;<i>Chærocampa Theylia</i>, Linn., like <i>Ch. Lewisii</i>
(note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_82">82</a>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_194">194</a>), appears to be another form
connecting the second and third phyletic groups of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
this genus. <i>Ch. Clotho</i>, Drury, belongs to the third
group (figured by Semper; see note 3 to this Appendix).
The larva of <i>Ch. Lucasii</i>, Walk., offers another instance
of the retention of the subdorsal line by an ocellated
species. The larva of <i>Ch. Lycetus</i>, Cram., of which
Mr. Moore was so good as to show me descriptions made
at the various stages of growth, presents many points of
interest. It belongs to the third phyletic group, and all
the ocelli appear at a very early stage. The dimorphism
appears also in the young larvæ, some being
green, and others black, a fact which may be explained
by the law of “backward transference” (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_274">274</a>). A
most suggestive feature is presented by the caudal horn,
which in the young caterpillar is stated to be <i>freely
movable</i>. It is possible that this horn, which was formerly
possessed by the ancestors of the <i>Sphingidæ</i>, and which
is now retained in many genera, is a remnant of a
flagellate organ having a similar function to the head-tentacles
of the <i>Papilio-larvæ</i>, or to the caudal appendages
of <i>Dicranura</i> (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_289">289</a>).</p>

<p><i>Lophostethus Dumolinii</i>, Angas.&mdash;The larva of this
species differs so remarkably from those of all other
<i>Sphingidæ</i>, that I have thought it of sufficient interest
to publish the following description, kindly furnished by
Mr. Roland Trimen, who in answer to my application
sent the following notes:&mdash;“My knowledge of the very
remarkable larva of this large and curious Smerinthine
Hawk-moth is derived from a photograph by the late
Dr. J. E. Seaman, and from drawings and notes recently
furnished by Mr. W. D. Gooch. The colour is greenish-white,
inclining to grey, and in the male there is a yellow,
but in the female a bluish, tinge in this. All the segments
but the second and the head bear strong black
spines, having a lustre of steel blue, and springing from
a pale yellow tubercular base. The longest of these
spines are in two dorsal rows from the fourth to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
eleventh segment, the pairs on the fourth and fifth segments
being longer than the rest, very erect, and armed
with short simple prickles for three-fourths of their upper
extremity. The anal horn, which is shorter than the
spines, is of the same character as the latter, being
covered with prickles, and much inclined backwards.
Two lateral rows of similar shorter spines extend from the
fourth to the 12th segment, and on each of the segments
6&ndash;11 the space between the upper and lower spines
is marked with a conspicuous pale yellow spot. Two
rows of smaller similar spines extend on each side (below
the two rows of larger ones) from the second to the
thirteenth segment, one spine of the lowermost row being
on the fleshy base of each pro-leg. All the pro-legs are
white close to the base, and russet-brown beyond.
Head smooth, unarmed in adult, greenish-white with two
longitudinal russet-brown stripes on face.</p>

<p>“The young larvæ have proportionally much longer and
more erect spines with distinct long prickles on them.
There is a short pair besides, either on the back of the
head or on the second segment. Moreover, the dorsal
spines of the third and fourth segments, and the anal
horn (which is quite erect, and the longest of all), are
longer than the rest, and distinctly <i>forked</i> at their
extremity.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gooch notes that these young larvæ might readily
be mistaken for those of the <i>Acrææ</i>, and suggests that
this may protect them. He also states that the yellow
lateral spots are only noticed after the last moult before
pupation, and that the general resemblance of the larva
as regards colour is to the faded leaves of its food-plant,
a species of <i>Dombeia</i>.”</p>

<p>The forked caudal horn in the young larva of this
species is of interest in connection with the similar
character of this appendage in the young caterpillar of
<i>Hyloicus Pinastri</i>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_265">265</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span></p>

<p><i>Retention of the Subdorsal Line by Ocellated Larvæ.</i>&mdash;It
has already been shown with reference to the eye-spots
of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ, that these markings have been
developed from the subdorsal line, and that, in accordance
with their function as a means of causing terror, this line
has in most species been eliminated in the course of the
phylogeny from those segments bearing the eye-spots
in order to give full effect to the latter (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_379">379</a>). In
accordance with the law that a character when it has
become useless gradually disappears, the subdorsal is
more or less absent in all those species in which the ocelli
are most perfectly developed; and it can be readily
imagined that in cases where adaptation to the foliage
exists the suppression of this line would under certain
conditions be accelerated by natural selection. On the
other hand, it is conceivable that the subdorsal line may
under other conditions be of use to a protectively
coloured ocellated species by imitating some special
part of the food-plant, under which circumstances its
retention would be secured by natural selection.</p>

<p>Such an instance is offered by <i>Chærocampa Capensis</i>,
Linn.; and as this case is particularly instructive as likewise
throwing light upon the retention of the subdorsal
by certain species having oblique stripes (see p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_377">377</a>, and
note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_166">166</a>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_378">378</a>), I will here give some details concerning
this species which have been communicated to me
by Mr. Roland Trimen, the well-known curator of the
South African Museum, Cape Town. The caterpillar of
<i>C. Capensis</i>, like so many other species of the genus, is
dimorphic, one form being a bright (rather pale) green,
and the other, which is much the rarer of the two, being
dull pinkish-red. Both these forms are adapted in colour to
the vine on which they feed, the red variety according to
some extent with the faded leaves of the cultivated vines,
but to a greater extent with the young shoots and underside
of the leaves of the South African native vine (<i>Cissus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
Capensis</i>), on which it also feeds. There are two
eye-spots in this species in the usual positions; they are
described as being blue-grey in a white ring, and raised so
as to project a little. The subdorsal is white, and is bordered
beneath by a wide shade of bluish-green irrorated
with white dots, and crossed by an indistinct white
oblique ray on each segment. These last markings are
probably remnants of an oblique striping formerly
possessed by the progenitor of this and other species of
the genus (see, for instance, Fig. 25, <a href="#Plate_IV">Pl. IV</a>., one of the
young stages of <i>C. Porcellus</i>). It is possible that these
rudimentary oblique stripes are now of service in assisting
the adaptation of the larva to its food-plant, but this
cannot be decided without seeing the insect <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>The subdorsal line extends from immediately behind
the second eye-spot to the base of the very short and
much curved violet anal horn. With reference to the
protective colouring Mr. Trimen writes:&mdash;“The difficulty
of seeing these large and beautifully-coloured larvæ on the
vines is quite surprising; six or more may be well within
sight, and yet quite unnoticed. The subdorsal stripe
greatly aids in their concealment, as it well represents in
its artificial light and shade the leaf-stalks of the vine.”
When this larva withdraws its front segments the eye-spots
stand out very menacingly; but in spite of this it is
greedily eaten by fowls and shrikes (<i>Fiscus Collaris</i>),
and Mr. Trimen also found that a tame suricate
(<i>Rhyzæna Suricata</i>) and a large monitor lizard (<i>Regenia
Albogularis</i>) did not refuse them. The failure of the
eye-spots in causing terror in these particular cases cannot
be regarded as disproving their utility in all instances. It
must always be borne in mind that no protective
character can possibly be of service against <i>all</i> foes;
natural selection only requires that such characters should
be advantageous with respect to the majority of the
enemies of any species, and further experiments with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
this caterpillar may show that in the case of smaller foes
the eye-spots are effective as a means of causing alarm.
The dimorphism of the larva of <i>C. Capensis</i> is of special
interest, although we are not yet sufficiently acquainted
with the habits of this species to offer a complete explanation.
According to Dr. Weismann’s conclusions
(p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_297">297</a>), the dimorphism of the <i>Chærocampa</i>-larvæ is due
to a double adaptation, the insects first having acquired
the habit of concealing themselves by day, and the dark
form having then been produced by the action of natural
selection, in order to adapt such varieties to the colour
of the soil, whilst others retained the green colour which
adapts them to the foliage of their food-plants. In
accordance with this, <i>C. Capensis</i> may have a similar
habit of concealment, or (should this be found not to be
the case) it is possible that this insect at a former period
possessed this habit and fed upon some other plant, when
it would have become dimorphic in the manner explained,
and the <i>existing</i> dimorphism may be a survival of the
more ancient dimorphism, the red form (corresponding
to the older dark form) having been subsequently modified
so as to become also adapted to the new food-plant.
Much light would be thrown upon this by studying the
ontogeny of the species.</p>

<p><i>Phytophagic Variability.</i>&mdash;A number of observations
bearing on the phytophagic variability of the Sphinx-larvæ
and other caterpillars have been recorded in a
previous <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_140">note</a> (p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_305">305</a>), and reference has also been made
to the food-plants of <i>Acherontia Atropos</i> in South Africa
(note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_121">121</a>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_263">263</a>). I am now enabled to add some
further observations on this species, from notes furnished
to me by Mr. Roland Trimen, who states that for many
years he has noticed that at the Cape this larva varies
greatly in the depth and shade of the green ground-colour,
the variability being in strict accordance with the
colour of the leaves of the particular plant on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
individual feeds. The phenomenon was particularly
noticeable in larvæ feeding on <i>Buxia Grandiflora</i>, a
shrub in common cultivation in gardens, and of which
the foliage is of a very dull pale greyish-green. Another
striking instance was noticed in some very fine caterpillars
feeding on a large shrubby <i>Solanum</i>, which, excepting
the bright yellow bands bordering the dorsal violet bars,
were generally dull ochreous-yellow, like the leaves and
stalks of the <i>Solanum</i>. On plants with bright green or
deep green leaves, the colour of the larvæ is almost in
exact agreement. Mr. Trimen adds:&mdash;“These remarks
apply principally to the underside and pro-legs and
lower lateral regions, the dorsal colours of violet and
yellow varying but little. The protection afforded is
very considerable, as the larvæ almost always cling to
the lower side of the twigs of their food-plants, so
that their uniformly-coloured under-surface is upwards,
and turned towards the light, and their variegated upper
surface turned downwards.”</p>

<p>These observations are of the highest importance, not
only as adding another instance to the recorded cases
of phytophagic variation, but likewise as showing that
with this variability a protective habit has been acquired.
It is to be hoped that such a promising field for experimental
investigation as is offered by this and analogous
cases will not long remain unexplored. In attacking the
problem two chief questions have in the first place to be
settled: (1) Is the variability truly phytophagic, <i>i.e.</i> are
the colour variations actually brought about by the
chemico-physiological action of the food-plant? and
(2) Are the larvæ at any period of growth susceptible to
the action of phytophagic influences? The first question
could be decided by feeding larvæ from the same batch
of eggs on different food-plants from the period of their
hatching. The second question could be settled by
changing the food-plants of a series of selected specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
at various stages of growth, and observing whether any
change of colour was produced. In accordance with the
principles advocated in a previous <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_140">note</a> (p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_305">305</a>), it is
conceivable <i>à priori</i> that phytophagic variability may
occur by direct chemico-physiological action, quite
irrespective of any of the changes of colour being of
protective use. In the case of brightly-coloured distasteful
species phytophagic variability might thus have
full play, but in the case of protectively-coloured edible
species, phytophagic variability would be under the
control of natural selection. These considerations raise
a question of the greatest theoretical interest in connection
with this phenomenon. If phytophagic variability
can have full play uncontrolled by natural selection
in brightly-coloured caterpillars, ought not this
phenomenon to be of more common occurrence in such
species than in those protectively coloured? Although
our knowledge of this subject is still very imperfect, as
a matter of fact brightly coloured larvæ, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, do not appear to be susceptible
of phytophagic influences. But this apparent contradiction,
instead of opposing actually confirms the foregoing
views, as will appear on further consideration.
The colours of protected species are as a whole much
inferior in brilliancy to those of inedible species, so that
any phytophagic effect would be more perceptible in the
former than in the latter, in which the highest possible
standard of brilliancy appears in most cases to have been
attained. Now phytophagic variations of colour appear
to be of but small amount, or, in other words, such
variations fluctuate within comparatively restricted limits,
and as the cases at present known are mostly <i>adaptive</i>
it is legitimate to conclude that they have been produced
and brought to their present standard by natural
selection, <i>i.e.</i> that they have arisen from phytophagic
influences as a cause of variability. The initial stages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
of phytophagic variations must therefore have been still
less perceptible than the now perfected final results; and
this leads to the conclusion that minute variations of
this character were of sufficient importance to protectively-coloured
species to be taken advantage of by
natural selection. But minute variations in a dull-coloured
larva would, as previously pointed out, produce
a comparatively much greater effect than such variations
in a brilliantly-coloured species; and as protection is
required by the former, the initial phytophagic effects
would be accumulated, and the power of adaptability
conferred by the continued action of natural selection,
whilst in vividly-coloured species where no power of
adaptability is required this cause of variation would not
only produce a result which, as compared with its effects
upon dull species, may be regarded as a “vanishing
quantity,” but this result would be too insignificant to
be taken advantage of by natural selection, which is in
these cases dealing only with large “quantities,” and
striving to make the caterpillars as brilliant as possible.
The fact that vividly-coloured distasteful larvæ do not
show phytophagic variation is to my mind explained
proximately by these considerations; the ultimate cause
of phytophagic variability regarded as a chemico-physiological
action requires further investigation.</p>

<p><i>Sexual Variation in Larvæ.</i>&mdash;Since most of the markings
of caterpillars can be explained by the two factors
of adaptation and inheritance, or, in other words, by their
present and past relations to the environment, and since
sexual selection can have played no direct part in producing
these colours and markings, I feel bound to record
here some few observations on the sexual differences
in larvæ in addition to the cases of <i>Anapæa</i> and
<i>Orgyia</i> already recorded (note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_141">i.</a>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_308">308</a>) and of
<i>Lophostethus Dumolinii</i> (p. <a href="#Page_527">527</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. C. V. Riley <span class="locked">states<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span> with reference to the larva
of <i>Thyreus Abboti</i> that the ground-colour appears to
depend upon the sex, Dr. Morris having described the
insect as “reddish-brown with numerous patches of
light green,” and having expressly stated that “the
<i>female</i> is of a uniform reddish-brown with an interrupted
dark-brown dorsal line and transverse striæ.” Mr.
W. D. Gooch, who has reared the South African butterflies
<i>Nymphalis Cithæron</i> and <i>N. Brutus</i> from their larvæ,
<span class="locked">states<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> that these “differed sexually in both instances.”
Of <i>Brutus</i> only a few were bred, but of <i>Cithæron</i> many.
“The sexual difference of the latter was that the females
had a large dorsal sub-cordate cream mark, which was
wanting, or only shown by a dot, in the males, and the
colour was more vivid in the edgings to the frontal
horns.”</p>

<p>Although such cases appear to be at present inexplicable,
they are of interest as examples of those

<h4 id="P2-A2">APPENDIX II.</h4>

<p>The following paper by Dr. Fritz Müller<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> forms the
third of a series of communications on Brazilian butterflies
published in “Kosmos,” and as it bears upon the
investigations made known in the third essay of the
present work, I will here give a translation, by permission
of the publisher, Herr Karl Alberts.</p>

<h5>“<span class="smcap">Acræa and the Maracujá Butterflies as
Larvæ, Pupæ, and Imagines.</span></h5>

<p>“In a thoughtful essay on ‘Phyletic Parallelism in
Metamorphic Species,’ Weismann has shown that in the
case of Lepidoptera the developmental stages of larva,
pupa, and imago vary independently, and that a change
occurring in one stage is without influence upon the preceding
and succeeding stages, so that the course which
has been followed by the individual stages in their
developmental history has not been in all cases identical.
This want of agreement may manifest itself both by
unequal divergence of form-relationship, and by unequal
group formation. With respect to unequal form-divergence
the caterpillars are sometimes more closely related
in form than their imagines, and at other times the reverse
is the case. With respect to unequal group formation
again, two cases are possible; the larvæ and imagines
may form groups of unequal value, the one stage forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
higher or lower groups than the other, or they may
form groups of unequal size, <i>i.e.</i>, groups which do not
coincide but which overlap. Form-relationship and
blood-relationship do not therefore always agree; the
resemblances among the caterpillars would lead to a quite
different arrangement to that resulting from the resemblances
among the imagines, and it is probable that
neither of these arrangements would correspond with
the actual relationships.</p>

<p>“Starting from this fact, which he establishes by
numerous examples, Weismann proceeds to show most
convincingly that an innate power of development or of
transformation, such as has been assumed under various
names by many adherents of the development theory,
has no existence, but that every modification and advancement
in species has been called forth by external
influences.</p>

<p>“A most beautiful illustration of the want of ‘phyletic
parallelism,’ as Weismann designates the different form-relationships
of the larvæ, pupæ, and imagines, is furnished
by the five genera <i>Acræa</i>, <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>,
<i>Colænis</i>, and <i>Dione</i> (= <i>Agraulis</i>). This instance seems
to me to be of especial value, because it offers the rare
case of pupæ showing greater differences than the larvæ
and imagines.</p>

<p>“The species of which I observed the larvæ and pupæ
are <i>Acræa Thalia</i> and <i>Alalia</i>, <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>, <i>Eueides
Isabella</i>, <i>Colænis Dido</i> and <i>Julia</i>, <i>Dione Vanillæ</i> and
<i>Juno</i>; besides these I noticed the pupa of <i>Eueides
Aliphera</i>.</p>

<p>“The following remarks apply only to these species,
although we may suppose with great probability that the
whole of the congeneric forms&mdash;excepting perhaps the
widely ranging species of <i>Acræa</i>&mdash;would display similar
characters to their Brazilian representatives.</p>

<p>“The imagines of the five genera mentioned form two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
sharply defined families, the <i>Acræidæ</i> and the butterflies
of the Maracujá <span class="locked">group.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span> The latter comprises the three
genera <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>, and <i>Colænis</i>, which differ
only in very unimportant characters; <i>Eueides</i> is distinguished
from <i>Heliconius</i> by its shorter antennæ, and
<i>Colænis</i> differs from <i>Eueides</i> in having the discoidal cell
of the hind-wings open. The genus <i>Dione</i> is further
removed by the different structure of the legs, and the
silvery spots on the underside of the wings. Certain
species resemble those of other genera in a most striking
manner, and much more closely both in colour and
marking, and even in the form of their wings, than they
do their own congeners. This is the case with <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> and <i>Eueides Pavana</i>, with <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i> and
<i>Eueides Isabella</i>, and with <i>Eueides Aliphera</i> and <i>Colænis
Julia</i>, which are deceptively alike, and the last two are
connected with <i>Dione Juno</i>, at least by the upper side of
the wings. The difficulty of judging of the relationships
of the single species is thus much aggravated; it cannot
be said how much of this resemblance is to be attributed
to blood-relationship, and how much to deceptive
imitation.</p>

<p>“As larvæ all the Brazilian species must be placed <i>in
one genus</i>, as they agree exactly in the number and
arrangement of their spines (4 spines, not in a transverse
row, on segments 2 and 3; 6 spines, in a transverse row,
on segments 4&ndash;11; 4 spines, not in a transverse row,
on the last (12th) segment). They differ from one
another much less in this respect than do the German
species of <i>Vanessa</i>, such, for instance, as <i>V. Io</i> or <i>Antiopa</i>
from <i>V. Polychloros</i>, <i>Urticæ</i>, and <i>Atalanta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> The larvæ
of <i>Acræa Thalia</i> are certainly without the two spines on
the head which the others possess, and, on the other
hand, they have a well-developed pair of spines on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
first segment, which, in most of the other species, are
completely absent; but this does not justify their
separation, since the head spines of <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>,
and <i>Colænis Dido</i>, which are of a considerable length,
are shorter than those of the next segment in <i>Colænis
Julia</i>, and <i>Dione Vanillæ</i>, and in <i>Dione Juno</i> they
dwindle down to two minute points, this last species also
bearing a short pair on the first segment. The larva of
<i>Dione Juno</i> is thus as closely related to that of <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> as it is to that of its congener <i>Dione Vanillæ</i>.</p>

<p>“If it were desired to form two distinct larval groups
this could not be effected on the basis of their differences
in form, but could only be based on their food-plants.
The larvæ of <i>Heliconius</i>, <i>Eueides</i>, <i>Colænis</i>, and
<i>Dione</i> live on species of Maracujá (Passiflora); those of
<i>Acræa Thalia</i> and <i>Alalia</i> on Compositæ (<i>Mikania</i> and
<i>Veronia</i>). These larval groups would agree with those
founded on the form-relationships of the imagines, but
unlike the imaginal groups, which can be formed into
families, they would scarcely possess a generic value.</p>

<p>“If we arrange the single species of caterpillars according
to their resemblances, this arrangement does not
agree with that based on the resemblances of the
imagines, even if we disregard the different values of the
groups. The result is somewhat as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>[Here follow the remarks on the habits of the larvæ
in connection with their colours, &amp;c., which have already
been quoted in illustration of the use of the spiny protection
(note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Footnote_133">133</a>, p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47847/47847-h/47847-h.htm#Page_293">293</a>). From these facts the author
draws the conclusion that the form-relationships of the
caterpillars depend rather upon their mode of life than
upon their blood-relationships, assuming the latter to be
correctly expressed by the arrangement of the imagines
at present adopted.]</p>

</div>

<p>“A glance at the above figures of the pupæ of <i>Heliconius
Eucrate</i> (Fig. 2), <i>Eueides Isabella</i> (Fig. 3), and
<i>Colænis Dido</i> (Fig. 4), will show how great are the
differences between these pupæ as compared with the
close form-relationship of all the Maracujá butterflies,
and with the no less close resemblance of their larvæ.
A family which comprised three such dissimilar pupæ
would also be capable of including that of <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> (Fig. 1).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span></p>

<p>“The pupa of this last species has nothing peculiar in its
general appearance, but possesses the ordinary pupal
form; it is tolerably rounded, without any great elevations
or depressions; a minute pointed projection is
situated on the head over each eye-cover, and a similar
process projects from the roots of the wings. Its distinguishing
characters are five pairs of spines on the
back of the abdominal segments. These spines are found
also in <i>Acræa Alalia</i>, but appear to be absent in other
species, <i>e.g.</i> in the Indian <i>A. Violæ</i>. Last summer,
among some batches of <i>Thalia</i> larvæ&mdash;each batch being
the progeny from one lot of eggs&mdash;I found certain individuals
which differed from the others in having much
shorter spines, and these changed into pupæ in which
the five pairs of spines were proportionally shorter than
usual, thus being an exception to the rule that changes
in one stage of development are without influence on
the other stages. I may remark, by the way, that this law,
enunciated by Weismann, can only be applied to imagines
and pupæ with certain restrictions. The skin of the pupa
forms a sheath or cover for the eyes, antennæ, trunk,
legs, and wings of the imago, and if these parts undergo
any considerable modification in the latter, corresponding
changes must appear in the pupa. This is shown, for
instance, by many ‘Skippers’ (<i>Hesperidæ</i>), in which the
extraordinarily long trunk necessitates a sheath of a
corresponding length. The colour of the pupa of <i>Acræa
Thalia</i> is whitish, the wing-veins with some other
markings and the spines are black; metallic spots are
absent.</p>

<p>“In the pupa of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i> the laterally compressed
region of the wings is raised into a large projection,
the antennal sheaths lying on the edges of the
wings are serrated and beset with short pointed spines;
instead of the minute projections of <i>Acræa Thalia</i>, the
head bears two large humped processes; the body is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
raised on each side into a foliaceous border carrying five
spines of different lengths, the foremost pair, directed
towards the head, being the longest. The pupa is brown,
and ornamented with four pairs of brilliant metallic
spots, one pair close behind the antennæ, and three
pairs, almost coalescent, on the back before the longest
pair of spines. A short spine projects from the
middle of each of the latter somewhat arched metallic
patches.</p>

<p>“In the pupa of <i>Colænis Dido</i> (which resembles that
of <i>Colænis Julia</i>, and to which may be added those of
<i>Dione Vanillæ</i> and <i>Juno</i>) the spines are absent, the wing
region is but moderately arched, and the antennæ
marked only by small elevations; instead of the leaf-like
border, there are on each side of the back five knotty
or humped processes. The metallic spots are similar in
number and position to those of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>;
those on the back have a wart-like process in the
middle, instead of a spine.</p>

<p>“The pupæ of <i>Heliconius</i> and <i>Colænis</i> when moving
their posterior segments rapidly, as they do whenever
they are disturbed, produce a very perceptible hissing
noise by the friction of these segments, this sound, which
is especially noticeable in the case of <i>Heliconius Eucrate</i>,
perhaps serving to terrify small foes. (So loud is the
sound produced in this manner by the pupæ of <i>Epicalia
Numilia</i>, that my children have named them ‘<i>Schreipuppen</i>.’)</p>

<p>“The pupæ of <i>Heliconius</i> and <i>Colænis</i> thus differ to a
much greater extent than the imagines or larvæ, and
the same holds good for <i>Eueides</i> in a much higher
degree as compared with its above-mentioned allies.
The larvæ of <i>Eueides</i> have no distinctive characters, and
even the generic rank of the imagines is doubtful; as
pupæ, on the other hand, they are far removed (even by
their mode of suspension) not only from the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
of the Maracujá group and from the whole of the great
Nymphalideous group (<i>Danainæ</i>, <i>Satyrinæ</i>, <i>Elymniinæ</i>,
<i>Brassolinæ</i>, <i>Morphinæ</i>, <i>Acræinæ</i> and <i>Nymphalinæ</i>), but
from almost all other butterflies. The larva pupates on the
underside of a leaf; the pupa is fastened by the tail,
but does not hang down like the pupæ of the other
<i>Nymphalidæ</i>,&mdash;its last segments are so curved that the
breast of the chrysalis is in contact with the underside
of the leaf. I am not acquainted with any other pupa
among those not suspended by a girdle which assumes
such a position. Something similar occurs, however, in
the pupa of <i>Stalachtis</i>, which is without a girdle, and
according to Bates, is ‘kept in an inclined position by
the fastening of the tail.’ By this peculiarity Bates
distinguishes the <i>Stalachtinæ</i> from the <i>Libytheæ</i> with
pupæ ‘freely suspended by the tail.’</p>

<p>“Besides through this peculiar position of the body,
the pupa of <i>Eueides Isabella</i> is distinguished by short
hooked and long narrow sabre-like pairs of processes on
the back and head. Its colour is whitish, yellowish,
or sordid yellowish-grey; in the last variety both the
four long dorsal processes and the surrounding portions,
as well as the points of the other processes, remain
white or yellowish. The pupa <i>Eueides Aliphera</i> is very
similar, only all the processes are somewhat shorter, the
four longest (dorsal) and some other markings being
black.</p>

<p>“Now if, as Weismann has attempted to show for
larvæ and imagines, the form-divergence always ‘corresponds
exactly with the divergence in the mode of life,’
the question arises as to what difference in the conditions
of life has brought about such a considerable form-divergence
between the pupæ of such closely allied species
as the Maracujá butterflies. In pupæ which do not eat
or drink, and which have neither to seek in courtship nor
to care for progeny, it is only protection from foes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
can concern us. But in the pupæ of nearly allied species
of which the larvæ feed on kindred plants in the same
districts at the same periods of the year, can the enemies
be so different as to produce such a considerable divergence
in form? One might answer this question in the
negative with some confidence, and affirm that in this
case the difference in the pupæ does not result from
the ‘divergence in the mode of life,’ or from the difference
in the external conditions, but is accidental,
<i>i.e.</i> a consequence of some fortunate variation induced
by some external cause, which variation afforded protection
against common foes&mdash;to one species in one
way, and to the other species in some other way; this
course, once entered upon, having been urged on by
natural selection, until at length the wide divergence
now shown is attained. How in the case of any of
the species the peculiarity in colour or form can actually
serve as a protection, I must confess myself at fault in
answering. Only in the case of the pupa of <i>Eueides
Isabella</i> will I venture to offer a supposition. That it
is not green like other pupæ which suspend themselves
among foliage (<i>Siderone</i>, <i>Epicalia,</i> <i>Callidryas</i>, &amp;c.), but
contrasts more or less brightly with the dark green of
the leaves, precludes the idea of concealment; on the
other hand its colour is too dull to serve as a conspicuous
sign of distastefulness. In either case the meaning of
the wonderful processes of the pupa would remain unexplained.</p>

<p>“We are thus compelled to seek another possibility in
mimicry, by which foes would be deceived by deceptive
resemblance. But what is the object imitated? Dead
insects overgrown by fungi are often found on leaves,
the whitish or yellowish fungi growing from their bodies
in various fantastic forms. Such insects of course no longer
serve as tempting morsels. The processes of the pupa of
<i>Eueides</i> suggest such fungoid growths, although I certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
cannot assert that to our eyes in broad daylight the
resemblance is very striking. But the pupæ hang among
the shadows of the leaves, and a less perfect imitation
may deceive foes that are not so sharp-sighted; protective
resemblance must commence moreover with an
imperfect degree of imitation.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE MEXICAN AXOLOTL
INTO AMBLYSTOMA.</span></h3>

<h4 id="P3-Intro">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>Since the time when Duméril made known the
transformation of a number of Axolotls into the
so-called Amblystoma form, this Mexican Amphibian
has been bred in many European aquaria,
chiefly with the view to establish the conditions
under which this transformation occurred, so as to
be enabled to draw further conclusions as to the
true causes of this exceptional and enigmatical
metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Although the Amphibians propagated freely,
the cases in which transformation occurred remained
extremely rare, and it was not once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
possible to reply to the main question, viz.
whether this metamorphosis was determined by
external conditions or by purely internal causes;
to say nothing of the possibility of there perhaps
being discoverable certain definite external influences
by means of which the metamorphosis
could have been induced with certainty. But
while these points are undecided all attempted
theoretical interpretations of the phenomenon
must be devoid of a solid basis.</p>

<p>It appeared to me from the first that the history
of this transformation of the Axolotl was of
special theoretical value; indeed I believed that
it might possibly furnish a special case for deciding
the truth of those ground-principles,
according to which the origin of this species is
represented by the two conflicting schools as a
case of transformation or as one of heterogenesis.
I therefore determined to make some experiments
with the Axolotl myself, in the hopes of being
fortunate enough to be able to throw some light
upon the subject.</p>

<p>In the year 1872 Prof. v. Kölliker was so good
as to leave with me five specimens of his Axolotls,
bred in Würzburg, and these furnished a numerous
progeny in the following year. With these I
carried out the idea, the theoretical bearing of
which will be shown subsequently, whether it
would not be possible to force all the larvæ, or
at any rate, the greater majority, to undergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
transformation by exposing them to conditions of
life which made the use of gills difficult, and that
of lungs more easy; in other words, by compelling
them to live partly on land at a certain
stage of life.</p>

<p>During that year indeed I obtained no results,
most of the larvæ perishing before the time for
such an experiment had arrived, and the few
survivors did not undergo transformation, but
lived on to the following spring and then also
died one after the other. Through long absence
from Freiburg, necessitated by other labours, I
had evidently left them without sufficient care
and attention. I was thus led to the conviction,
which was more fully confirmed subsequently,
that no results can be obtained without the
greatest care and attention in rearing, towards
which single object all one’s interest should be
concentrated, and it must not be considered
irksome to have to devote daily for many months
a large amount of time to this experiment. As
it was evident that I could not afford this time
without calling in other aid, I hailed with pleasure
an opportunity of witnessing the experiment performed
by other hands.</p>

<p>A lady living here (Freiburg), Fräulein v.
Chauvin, undertook to rear a number of my larvæ
of the following year which had just hatched, and
in accordance with my idea to make the experiment
of forcibly compelling them to adopt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
Amblystoma form. How completely this was
accomplished will be seen from the following
notes by the lady herself, and it will no less
appear that these results were only obtained by
that care in treatment and delicacy of observation
which she devoted to the experiments.</p>

<h4>EXPERIMENTS.</h4>

<p>“I began the experiments on June 12th, 1874,
with five larvæ about eight days old, these being
the only survivors out of twelve. Owing to the
extraordinary delicacy of these creatures, the
quality and temperature of the water, and the
nature and quantity of their food exerts the greatest
influence, especially in early life, and one cannot
be too cautious in their treatment.</p>

<p>“The specimens were kept in a glass globe of
about thirty centimeters in diameter, the temperature
of the water being regulated; as food at
first Daphnids, and afterwards larger aquatic
animals were introduced in large numbers. By
this means all the five larvæ throve excellently.
At the end of June the rudiments of the front
legs appeared in the most vigorous specimens,
and on the 9th of July the hind legs also became
visible. At the end of November I noticed that
one Axolotl remained constantly at the surface of
the water, and this led me to suppose that the
right period had now arrived for effecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
transformation into Amblystoma. For brevity I
shall designate this as No. I., and the succeeding
specimens by corresponding Roman numerals.</p>

<p>“In order to bring about this metamorphosis,
on December 1st, 1874, No. I. was placed in a
large-sized glass vessel containing earth arranged
in such a manner that, when the vessel was filled
with water, only one portion of the surface of the
earth was entirely covered by the liquid, and the
creature in the course of its frequent perigrinations
was thus more or less exposed to the air. The
water was gradually diminished on the following
days, during which period the first changes made
their appearance in the Amphibian&mdash;<i>the gills
commenced to shrivel up</i>, and at the same time
the creature showed a tendency to seek the
shallowest spots. On December 4th, it took
entirely to the land, and concealed itself among
some damp moss which I had placed on a heap
of sand on the highest portion of the earth in the
glass vessel. At this period the first ecdysis
occurred. Within the four days from the 1st to
the 4th of December, a striking change took
place in the external appearance of No. I., the gill-tufts
shrivelled up almost entirely, the dorsal
crest completely disappeared, and the tail, which
had hitherto been broad, became rounded and
similarly formed to that of a land salamander.
The grey-brown colour of the body changed gradually
into a blackish hue; isolated spots, at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
of a dull white, made their appearance and these in
time increased in intensity.</p>

<p>“When the Axolotl left the water on December
4th the gill-clefts were still open, but these closed
gradually, and after about eight days were overgrown
with skin and no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>“Of the other larvæ three appeared at the end
of November (<i>i.e.</i> at the same time when No. I.
came to the surface of the water) to have kept
pace in development with No. I., an indication
that for these also the right period had arrived for
accelerating the developmental processes. They
were therefore submitted to the same treatment as
No. I. No. II. became transformed at the same
time and exactly in the same manner as the latter;
its gill-tufts were complete when it was first placed
in the shallow water, but after four days these had
almost entirely disappeared; in the course of about
ten days after it took to the land, the overgrowth
of skin on the gill-clefts and the complete assumption
of the salamander form occurred. During
this last period the creature took food, but only
when urged to do so.</p>

<p>“In Nos. III. and IV. the development proceeded
more slowly. Neither of these so frequently
sought the shallow spots, nor did they as a rule
remain so long exposed to the air, so that the
greater part of January had expired before they
took entirely to the land. Nevertheless the dessication
of the gill-tufts did not take a longer time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
than in Nos. I. and II. as the first ecdysis occurred
as soon as they took to the land.</p>

<p>“No. V. showed still more striking deviations in
its transformation than Nos. III. and IV., but as
this specimen appeared much weaker than the
others from the beginning and was retarded in
growth to a most notable extent, this is by no
means surprising. It took fourteen instead of four
days before the transformation had advanced far
enough to enable it to leave the water. It was
especially interesting to observe the behaviour of
this specimen during this period. Its weak and
delicate constitution evidently made it much more
susceptible to all external influences than the others.
If exposed to the air for too long a time it acquired
a light colour, and when annoyed or alarmed it
emitted a peculiar odour, similar to that of a
salamander. As soon as these phenomena were
observed it was at once placed in deeper water, into
which it immediately plunged and gradually recovered
itself, the gills always becoming again
expanded. The same experiment was repeated
several times and always led to the same
result, from which we may venture to conclude
that by accelerating the transformation
too energetically, the process may come to a
standstill, and even by continued compulsion may
end in death.</p>

<p>“It yet remains to be mentioned with respect to
Axolotl No. V. that this specimen, unlike all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
others, did not emerge from the water at the first
ecdysis, but at the time of the fourth.</p>

<p>“All the Axolotls are now (July, 1875) living,
and are healthy and vigorous, so that with respect
to their state of nourishment there is nothing to
prevent their propagating. Of the first four the
largest is fifteen centim. long; Axolotl No. V.
measures twelve centim.</p>

<p>“The preceding statements appear to demonstrate
the correctness of the views advanced in the
Introduction:&mdash;Axolotl larvæ generally but not
always complete their metamorphosis if, in the
first place, they emerge sound from the egg and
are properly fed; and if, in the next place, they are
submitted to the necessary treatment for changing
aquatic into aërial respiration. It is obvious that
this treatment must only be applied very gradually,
and in such a manner as not to overtax the vital
energy of the Amphibian.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To the foregoing remarks of Fräulein v. Chauvin
I may add that in all five cases the transformation
was complete, and not to be confounded with that
change which occurs more or less in all Axolotls
in the course of time when confined in small glass
vessels. In this last case there frequently appear
changes in the direction of the Amblystoma form
without the latter being actually reached. In the
five adult Axolotls which I possessed for a short
time, and of which two were at least four years old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
the gills were much shrivelled, but the aquatic tail
and dorsal crest were unchanged. The crest may,
however, also disappear, and the tail become
shortened without these changes being due to a
transformation into Amblystoma, as will be shown
further on.</p>

<p>With respect to the duration of the transformation,
this amounted in Axolotls Nos. I. to IV.
altogether to twelve or fourteen days. Of these,
four days were taken by the first changes which
occurred while the creature was still in the water;
the remaining time, to the completion of the metamorphosis,
was passed on land. Duméril gives
the duration of the metamorphosis as sixteen
days.</p>

<p>The following results of the experiments just described
appear to me to be especially noteworthy:&mdash;The
five Axolotl larvæ which can alone be taken
into consideration, the others having soon perished,
all experienced metamorphosis, and without an exception
became Amblystomas. Only one of them,
No. I., by persistently swimming at the surface,
as was observed at the end of six months, showed
a decided tendency to undergo metamorphosis
and to adopt aërial respiration. With respect to
this specimen it may therefore be confidently
assumed that it would have taken to the land, and
that metamorphosis would have occurred without
artificial aid, just as was the case in the thirty
specimens which Duméril altogether observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting Nos. II., III., and IV., on the other
hand, such a supposition is but little probable.
These three larvæ endeavoured to keep in deep
water and avoided as long as possible the shallow
places which would have enforced them to take
entirely to lung breathing. Metamorphosis thus
occurred more than a month later in these
individuals.</p>

<p>Finally, there can scarcely be any doubt that
No. V. would not have become transformed without
forcible adaptation to an aërial life.</p>

<p>From these results we may venture to conclude
that most Axolotl larvæ change into the Amblystoma
form when, at the age of six to nine months,
they are placed in such shallow water that they are
compelled to respire chiefly by their lungs. The
experiments before us are certainly at present but
very few in number, but such a conclusion cannot
be termed premature if we consider that out of
several hundred Axolotls (the exact number is not
given) Duméril obtained only about thirty Amblystomas,
while v. Kölliker bred only one Amblystoma
out of a hundred Axolotls.</p>

<p>It now only remains questionable whether <i>each
larva</i> could have been forced to undergo metamorphosis,
but this could only be decided by new
experiments. It was originally my intention to
have delayed the publication of the experiments
till Fräulein v. Chauvin had repeated them in larger
numbers, but as my Axolotls have not bred this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
year (1875) I must abandon my scheme, and this
can be done the more readily because, for the
theoretical consideration of the facts, it is immaterial
whether <i>all</i> or only <i>nearly all</i> the Axolotls
could have been compelled to undergo transformation.
I must not, however, omit to mention that
Herr Gehrig, the curator of our Zoological
Museum, bred a considerable number of larvæ
from the same brood as that with which Fräulein
v. Chauvin experimented, and that of these larvæ
six lived over the winter <i>without undergoing metamorphosis</i>.
They were always kept in deep water
and thus furnished the converse experiment to
those recorded above; they further prove that this
whole brood did not have a previous tendency to
undergo metamorphosis.</p>

<p>If these new facts are to be made use of to
explain the nature of this extraordinary process of
transformation in accordance with our present
conception, the data already known must in the
first place be called to our aid.</p>

<p>It has first to be established that <i>Siredon
Mexicanus</i> never, as far as we know, undergoes
metamorphosis in its native country. This Amphibian
is there only known in the <i>Siredon</i> form, a
statement which I have taken from De <span class="locked">Saussure,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span>
who has himself observed the Axolotl in the Mexican
lakes. This naturalist never found a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
Amblystoma in the neighbourhood of the lakes,
“nevertheless the larva (Axolotl) is so common
there that it is brought into the market by thousands.”
De Saussure believes that in Mexico the
Axolotl does not undergo <span class="locked">transformation.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span> The
same statement is distinctly made by <span class="locked">Cope,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> whose
specimens of <i>Siredon Mexicanus</i> bred in America,
even in captivity showed “no tendency to become
metamorphosed.” On the other hand Tegetmeier
<span class="locked">observed<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> that one out of five specimens obtained
from the Lake of Mexico underwent metamorphosis,
and this accordingly establishes the second fact,
viz. that the true Axolotl becomes transformed
under certain conditions into an Amblystoma when
in captivity.</p>

<p>This last remark would be superfluous if, as was
for a long time believed, the Paris Axolotls, of
which the metamorphosis was first observed and
which at the time made such a sensation, were
actually <i>Siredon Mexicanus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>Siredon</i> which
alone in its native country bears the name of
Axolotl. In his first communication Duméril was
himself of this opinion; he then termed the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
“<i>Siredon Mexicanus vel Humboldtii</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> but subsequently,
in his amplified <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> on the transformation
of the Axolotl observed in the Jardin
des Plantes, he retracted this view, and after a
critical comparison of the five described species
of <i>Siredon</i>, he came to the conclusion that the
species in the possession of the Paris Museum was
probably <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i> (Baird). All the
transformations of Axolotls observed in Europe
must consequently be referred to this species,
since they were&mdash;at least as far as I know&mdash;all
derived from the Paris colony. My own experimental
specimens were also indirectly descended
from these.</p>

<p>Now it must be admitted that this does not
coincide with the fact that the Amblystoma form
which Duméril first obtained from his Axolotls
agreed with Cope’s species, <i>A. Tigrinum</i>, while on
the other hand we learn from <span class="locked">Marsh<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> that <i>Siredon
Lichenoides</i> (Baird), when it does undergo metamorphosis,
becomes transformed into <i>Amblystoma
Mavortium</i> (Baird).</p>

<p>Marsh found <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i> in mountain
lakes (7000 feet above the sea) in the southwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
of the United States (Wyoming Territory),
and obtained from them, by breeding in aquaria,
<i>Amblystoma Mavortium</i> (Baird). He considers
it indeed doubtful whether the Amphibian undergoes
this transformation in its native habitat,
although he certainly states this opinion without
rigorous proof on purely theoretical considerations,
because, according to his view, “the low temperature
is there less <span class="locked">favourable.”<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span></p>

<p>If I throw doubt upon this last statement it is
simply because <i>Amblystoma Mavortium</i> is found
native in many parts of the United States, viz:&mdash;in
California, New Mexico, Texas, Kansas,
Nebraska, and Minnesota. It is indeed by no
means inconceivable that in the mountain lakes
where Marsh obtained this species, it may behave
differently with respect to metamorphosis than in
other habitats, and this appears probable from
certain observations upon <i>Triton</i> which will be
subsequently referred to.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the absence of further observations,
we must admit that the Paris Axolotls were
not <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i>, but some nearly allied and
probably new species. But little information is
furnished by observing the course of the transformation,
although it is at least established that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
Axolotl in its native habitat does not undergo
metamorphosis or does so as exceptionally as in
Europe. Unfortunately in his papers Duméril
gives no precise statement respecting the locality
of this species imported from “Mexico”&mdash;it is
probable that he was himself unacquainted with
it, so that I can only state on the authority of
Cope that Amblystoma has never been brought
from south of the provinces of Tamaulipas
and Chilhuahua, <i>i.e.</i> south of the Tropic of
<span class="locked">Cancer.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span></p>

<p>This last statement, however, gives no certainty
to the matter. Of much more importance is the
above-mentioned fact, that the true Axolotl of the
lakes about the city of Mexico does not, as a rule,
become transformed into an Amblystoma in that
locality, although this species in certain cases
undergoes metamorphosis when in confinement.
From this circumstance and from the fact that the
Paris Axolotl likewise experienced but a very small
percentage of metamorphosis in captivity, we may
venture to conclude that this species also, in its
native habitat, either does not become transformed
at all or does so only exceptionally.</p>

<p>But there is yet another body of facts which
come prominently into view on considering the
history of the transformations. I refer to the
existence of numerous species of <i>Amblystoma</i> in a
natural state. In the “Revision of the genera of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
<i>Salamandridæ</i>,” published some years ago by
<span class="locked">Strauch,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span> this author, following <span class="locked">Cope,<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> gives
twenty species of <i>Amblystoma</i> as inhabiting North
America. Although some of these species are
based on single examples, and consequently, as
Strauch justly remarks, “may well have to be
reduced in the course of time,” there must nevertheless
always remain a large number of species
which live and propagate as true Amblystomas,
and of which the habitat extends from the latitude
of New York to that of New Mexico. There are
therefore true species of <i>Siredon</i> which regularly
assume the Amblystoma form under their natural
conditions of life, and which propagate in this
form, while, on the other hand, there are at least
two species which, under their existing natural conditions
of life, always propagate as <i>Siredon</i>. It is
but another mode of expression for the same facts
if we say that the Mexican Axolotl and the Paris
<i>Siredon</i>&mdash;whether this is <i>Lichenoides</i> or some other
species&mdash;stand at a lower grade of phyletic
development than those species of <i>Amblystoma</i>
which propagate in the salamander form. No one
can raise any objection to this statement, while the
alternative view maintained by all authors contains
a theory either expressed or implied which is, as I
believe, incorrect, viz. that the Mexican Axolotl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
<i>has remained</i> at an inferior stage of phyletic
development.</p>

<p>All <span class="locked">zoologists<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span> who have expressed an opinion
upon the transformation of the Axolotl, and
who are not, like the first observer of this fact,
embarrassed by Cuvier’s views as to the immutability
of species, regard the phenomenon as though
a species, which owing to some special conditions
had hitherto remained at a low stage of development,
had now through some other influences been
compelled to advance to a higher stage.</p>

<p>I believed for a long time that the phenomenon
could not otherwise be comprehended, so little was
I then in a position to bring all the facts into harmony
with this view. Thus in the year 1872 I
expressed myself as <span class="locked">follows<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span>:&mdash;“Why should not
a sudden change in all the conditions of life (transference
from Mexico to Paris) have a direct action
on the organization of the Axolotl, causing it suddenly
to reach a higher stage of development, such
as many of its allies have already attained, and
which obviously lies in the nature of its organization&mdash;a
stage which it would perhaps itself have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
reached, although later, in its native country? Or
is it inconceivable that the sudden removal from
8000 feet above the sea (Mexican plateau) to the
altitude of Paris, may have given the respiratory
organs an impetus in the direction of the transformation
imminent? In all probability we have here
to do with the direct action of changed conditions
of life.”</p>

<p>That the substance of this last statement must
still hold good is obvious from the experiments previously
described, which show that by the application
of definite external influences, we have it to a
certain extent in our power to produce the transformation.
It is precisely in this last point that
there lies the new feature furnished by these experiments.</p>

<p>But are we also compelled to interpret the phenomenon
in the above manner? <i>i.e.</i> as a sudden
advance in the phyletic development of the species
occurring, so to speak, at one stroke? I believe
not.</p>

<p>What first made this view appear to me erroneous,
was the appearance of the living Amblystomas
bred from my Axolotl larvæ. These creatures
by no means differed from the Axolotls merely in
single characters, but they were distinct from
the latter in their entire aspect; they differed in
some measure in all their parts, in some but
slightly and in other parts strongly&mdash;in brief, they
had become quite different animals. In accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
with this, their mode of life had become completely
modified; they no longer lived in the water,
but remained concealed by day among the damp
moss of the vivarium, coming forth only by night
in search of food in dry places.</p>

<p>I had been able to perceive the great difference
between the two stages of development from the
anatomical data with which I had long been
familiar, and which Duméril had made known with
respect to the structure of his Amblystomas. But
the collecting of numerous details gives no very
vivid picture of the metamorphosis; it was the
appearance of the living animal that first made me
conscious how deep-seated was the transformation
which we have here before us, and that this change
not merely affected those parts which would be
directly influenced by the change in the conditions
of life, such as the gills, but that most if not all
the parts of the animal underwent a transformation,
which could in part be well explained as morphological
adaptation to new conditions of life, and
partly as a consequence of this adaptation (correlative
changes), but could not possibly be regarded
as the sudden action of these changed
conditions.</p>

<p>Such at least is my view of the case, according
to which a <i>per saltum</i> development of the species
of such a kind as must here have taken place, is
quite inconceivable.</p>

<p>I may venture to assume that most observers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
of the metamorphosis of Axolotl have, like myself,
not been hitherto aware of the extent of the
transformation, and it may thus be explained why
the theoretical bearings of the case have on all
sides been incorrectly conceived. We have here
obviously a quite extraordinary case of the first
order of importance. I believe that it can easily
be shown that the explanation of the history of the
metamorphosis of the Paris Axolotl which has
hitherto been pretty generally accepted, necessarily
comprises a very far-reaching principle. If this
interpretation is correct, then in my opinion must
also hold good the ideas of those who, like Kölliker,
Askenasy, Nägeli, and, among the philosophers,
Hartmann and Hübner, would refer the transformation
of species in the first instance to a power
innate in the organism, to an active, <i>i.e.</i> a self-urging
“law of development”&mdash;a phyletic vital
force.</p>

<p>Thus, if the Axolotls transformed into Amblystomas
are regarded as individuals which, impelled
by external influences, have anticipated the phyletic
development of the others, then this advance can
only be ascribed to a phyletic vital force, since the
transformation is sudden, and leaves no time for
gradual adaptation in the course of generations.
The <i>indirect</i> influence of the external conditions
of life, <i>i.e.</i> natural selection, is thus excluded from
the beginning. But the <i>direct</i> action of the
changed conditions of life by no means furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
an explanation of the complete transformation of
the whole structure, such as I have already alluded
to, and which I will now enter into more closely.</p>

<p>The differences between the Paris Axolotl and
its Amblystoma according to Duméril, Kölliker,
and my own observations are as <span class="locked">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The gills disappear; the gill-clefts close up,
and of the branchial arches only the foremost remain,
the posterior ones disappearing. At the
same time the os <i>hyoideum</i> becomes changed
(Duméril).</p>

<p>2. The dorsal crest completely disappears
(Duméril).</p>

<p>3. The aquatic tail becomes transformed into
one like that of the salamanders (Duméril), which,
however, is not as in the salamander cylindrical,
but somewhat compressed laterally (Weismann).</p>

<p>4. The skin becomes yellowish white, irregularly
spotted on the sides and back (Duméril),
whilst at the same time its former grey-black
ground-colour changes into a shining greenish
black (Weismann); it loses, moreover, the slimy
secretion of the skin, and the cutaneous glands
become insignificant (Kölliker).</p>

<p>5. The eyes become prominent and the pupils
narrow (Kölliker), and eyelids capable of completely
covering the eyes are formed; in Axolotl
only a narrow annular fold surrounds the eyes, so
that these cannot be closed (Weismann).</p>

<p>6. The toes become narrowed and lose their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
skin-like appendages (Kölliker), or more precisely,
the half webs which connect the proximal extremities
of the toes on all the feet (Weismann).</p>

<p>7. The teeth are disposed in this species, as in
all other <i>Amblystomæ</i>, in transverse series; whilst
in Axolotl, as in <i>Triton</i> larvæ, they are arranged
at the sides of the jaw in the form of a curved
arch-like band beset with several rows of <span class="locked">teeth.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span>
(Duméril. See his fig., <i>loc. cit.</i> p. 279).</p>

<p>8. In Axolotl the lower jaw, in addition to the
teeth on the upper edge of the bone, also bears
“de très petites dents disposées sur plusieurs
rangs;” these last disappear after metamorphosis
(Duméril). I will add that the persistent teeth
belong to the <i>os dentale</i> of the lower jaw, and
those that are shed to the <i>os operculare</i>.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>9. The surface of the posterior moveable part
of the body is slightly concave both before and
after transformation; the anterior part is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
less concave in <i>Amblystoma</i> than in <i>Siredon</i>
(Duméril).</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to verify Duméril’s 7th
and 9th statements, as I did not want to kill any
of my living <span class="locked">Amblystomas,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span> simply in order to
confirm the observations of a naturalist in whom
one may certainly place complete confidence.
Neither have I as yet observed the transformation
of the branchial arches, but all the other statements
of Kölliker and Duméril I can entirely corroborate.</p>

<p>The structural differences between Axolotl and
Amblystoma are considerably greater and of more
importance than those between allied genera, or
indeed than between the families of the Urodela.
The genus <i>Siredon</i> undoubtedly belongs to a
different sub-order to the genus <i>Amblystoma</i> into
which it occasionally becomes transformed.
Strauch, the most recent systematic worker at
this group, distinguishes the sub-order <i>Salamandrida</i>
from that of the <i>Ichthyodea</i> by the possession
of eyelids, and by the situation of the palatine
teeth in single rows on the posterior edge of
the palatal bone: in <i>Ichthyodea</i> the eyelids are
wanting and the palatine teeth are either “situated
on the anterior edge of the palatal bone,” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
“cover the whole surface of the palatal plates in
brush-like tufts.”</p>

<p>How is it possible to regard such widely divergent
anatomical characters as changes suddenly
produced by the action (but once exerted) of deviating
conditions of life? Hand in hand with the
shedding of the old and the appearance of new
palatine teeth, there occurs a change in the anatomical
structure of the vertebral column, and also&mdash;as
we may fairly conclude from Kölliker’s
correct observation of the cessation of the slimy
secretion&mdash;in the histological structure of the skin.
Who would undertake to explain all these profound
modifications as the direct and sudden
action of certain external influences? And if any
one were inclined to explain such changes as a
consequence of the disappearance of the gills, <i>i.e.</i>
as correlative changes, what else is such a correlation
than the phyletic vital force under another
name?</p>

<p>If from one change arising from the direct
action of external agencies, the whole body can in
two days become transformed in all its parts, in
the precise manner which appears best adapted for
the new conditions of life under which it is henceforward
to exist, then the word “correlation” is
only a phrase which explains nothing, but which
prevents any attempt at a better explanation, and
it would be preferable to profess simply the belief
in a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, it is hardly permissible to seek such
an explanation, since Urodela are known which
have no gills in the adult state, and which nevertheless
possess all the other characters of the <i>Ichthyodea</i>,
viz. want of eyelids, characteristic palatine
teeth, and the tongue bone. This is the case
with the genera <i>Amphiuma</i> (Linn.), <i>Menopoma</i>
(Harl.), and <i>Cryptobranchus</i> (v. d. Hoev.). The two
first genera, as is known, still possess gill-clefts,
but <i>Cryptobranchus</i> has even lost these clefts,
which, as in <i>Amblystoma</i>, are overgrown by skin;
nevertheless <i>Cryptobranchus</i> is, according to the
concurrent testimony of all systematists, a true
salamander in habits, tongue bone, palatine
<span class="locked">teeth,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span> &amp;c. It must further be added that the
Axolotl itself can lose the gills without thereby
becoming transformed into an Amblystoma. I
have previously mentioned that in Axolotls which
were kept in shallow water the gills frequently
became diminutive, and it also sometimes happens
that they completely shrivel up. I possess an
Axolotl preserved in alcohol in which the gills have
shrivelled up into small irregular bunches, and the
dorsal crest is also so completely absent that its
place is occupied by a long furrow, and even on the
tail the crest has entirely disappeared from the
lower edge and about half from the upper edge.
Notwithstanding this, the creature is widely removed
from Amblystoma in structure; it possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
the arched branchial apparatus, the palatine teeth,
the skin, &amp;c., of the Axolotl.</p>

<p>These facts prove, therefore, that the shedding
of the gills by no means always entails all the
other modifications which we observe in the metamorphosis
of Axolotl, so that these modifications
are thus not by any means the necessary and
immediate consequence of such gill shedding.</p>

<p>Whether these modifications will occur after a
long series of generations&mdash;whether the successors
of <i>Cryptobranchus</i> will also one day acquire the
salamandriform structure is another question, and
one which I could not exactly answer in the
negative. But this question does not here come
into consideration, as we are now only concerned
with the <i>immediate result</i> of the shedding of the
gills.</p>

<p>The problem appears therefore to be as follows:&mdash;Either
the hitherto received interpretation
of the transformational history of the Axolotl as a
further development of the species is incorrect, or
else the case of Axolotl incontestably proves the
existence of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>We have now to ask whether the facts of this
transformational history are not capable of another
explanation.</p>

<p>I believe that this is certainly possible, and that
another interpretation can be shown to be correct
with some degree of probability.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that those Amblystomas which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
have been developed in captivity in certain instances
from <i>Siredon Mexicanus</i> (<i>S. Pisciformis</i>),
as well as from the Paris Axolotls, are not progressive,
but reversion forms; I believe that the
Axolotls which now inhabit the Mexican lakes
were Amblystomas at a former geological (or
better, zoological) epoch, but that owing to
changes in their conditions of life, they have
reverted to the earlier perennibranchiate stage.</p>

<p>I was undoubtedly first led to this conception
by the results which arose from my studies on the
seasonal dimorphism of <span class="locked">butterflies.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span> In this case
we were also concerned with the two different
forms under which one and the same species
appears, and of which it was shown to be probable
that the one is phyletically older than the other.
The younger summer form, according to my view,
has arisen, through the gradual amelioration of the
climate, from the winter form, which at an earlier
zoological epoch was the only one in existence;
but the latter, the primary form, has not for this
reason ceased to exist, but now alternates in each
year as a winter form with the secondary summer
form.</p>

<p>Now with seasonally dimorphic butterflies, it
was easily possible to induce the summer brood to
assume the winter form by exposing their pupæ
for a long time to a low temperature; and it was
shown to be highly probable that this abrupt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
often very extensive change or transformation,
only apparently takes place suddenly, and is but
the apparent result of the action of cold upon this
generation, whilst in fact it depends upon reversion
to the primary form of the species, so that the
low temperature, which is only once applied, gives
but the impetus to reversion, and is not the true
cause of the transformation. This cause must
rather be sought in the long continued action of
the cold to which the ancestors of our existing
butterflies were subjected for thousands of generations,
and of which the final result is the winter
form.</p>

<p>If we assume for an instant that my interpretation
of the transformation of Axolotl as just offered
is correct, we should have conditions in many
respects analagous to those of seasonal dimorphism.
It is true that in this case the two forms
no longer alternate regularly with each other, but
the primary form may occasionally appear instead
of the secondary form, owing to the action of
external conditions.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of seasonal dimorphism it
is possible to compel the summer generation to
abandon the summer form, and to assume the
winter guise by the action of cold; so in the
present case we are able to induce the Axolotl to
adopt the Amblystoma form by making aërial
respiration compulsory at a certain stage of life;
and further, just as in seasonal dimorphism it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
be shown that this artificially produced change is
only apparently an abrupt transformation, and is
actually a reversion to the much older winter
form; so here we have not an actual, but only an
apparent remodelling of the species&mdash;a reversion
to the phyletically older form.</p>

<p>This certainly appears a paradox, inasmuch as
a form here arises by reversion which must yet
undoubtedly rank as the more highly developed.
I believe, however, that much which seems paradoxical
in this statement will disappear on further
examination.</p>

<p>It must in the first place be taken into consideration
that the phyletic development of species
need not by any means always take place by
advancement. We have indeed many cases of
retrogressive development, although in a somewhat
different sense, as with parasites and those
forms which have degenerated from free locomotion
to a sedentary mode of <span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> I do not
confuse this kind of retrogressive development,
arising from the arrest of certain organs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
systems of organs, with true reversion. The
latter is a return to a form which has already been
once in existence; but in the former case, in spite
of all simplification of the organization, some
entirely new feature always comes into existence.
But I am not able to see any absurdity in the
assumption that even true reversion, whether of a
whole species or of the individuals of a certain
district, may be regarded as possible, and I require
no further concession. Why, for example, should
it be inconceivable that at a very remote period
the Axolotl was adapted to a life on land; that
through the direct and indirect action of changed
conditions of life it gradually acquired the salamander
form, but that subsequently, through new
and unfavourable changes in the conditions of
life, it again relapsed to the older form, or at least
to one nearly related thereto?</p>

<p>At any rate such an assumption contains
nothing opposed to known facts, but can be supported
in many ways, and finally it commends
itself, at least in my opinion, as offering the only
admissible explanation of the facts before us.</p>

<p>The existence of a whole series of species of
<i>Amblystoma</i>, as already mentioned, at once shows
that species of <i>Siredon</i> can become elevated into
the salamander form, and can propagate regularly
in this state, and further, that this phyletic advance
has already actually taken place in many
species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span></p>

<p>That degeneration may also occur from this
high stage to a lower stage of development, is
shown by many observations on our water-salamanders.
It is known that under certain circumstances
Tritons, as it is generally expressed, become
“sexually mature in the larval condition.”</p>

<p>In the year 1864 De <span class="locked">Filippi<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span> found fifty Tritons
in a pool at Andermatten, in the neighbourhood of
Puneigen, and of these only two showed the
structure of the adult water-salamander; all the
others still possessed gills, but notwithstanding this,
they agreed in both sexes, in size and in the development
of the sexual organs, with mature animals.
De Filippi established that these “sexually mature
larvæ” not only resembled larvæ externally through
the possession of gills, but that they also possessed
all the other anatomical characters of the
larvæ, <i>i.e.</i> the characteristic bunches of palatine
teeth situated on both sides in the position of the
subsequent single rows, and a vertebral column
represented throughout its whole length by the
<i>chorda dorsalis</i>.</p>

<p>According to my view this would be a case of
the reversion of the Triton to the immediately anterior
phyletic stage, <i>i.e.</i> to the perennibranchiate
stage, and in the present instance the majority of
zoologists who take their stand by the theory of
descent, would certainly concur in this view. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
should at least consider it to be a useless play
upon words did we here speak of larval reproduction,
and thereby believe that we had explained
something. The animal certainly becomes sexually
mature in the same condition as that in which it first
appears as a larva, but we first get an insight into
the nature of this process by considering that this
so-called “sexually mature larva” has the precise
structure which must have been possessed by the
preceding phyletic stage of the species, and that
an individual reversion to the older phyletic stage
of the species is consequently before us. I maintain
that Duméril is in error in regarding this case
of the Triton as parallel with the true larval reproduction
of Wagner’s <i>Cecidomyia</i> larva. In
this last case it is certainly not reversion to an
older phyletic stage that confers the power of
reproduction upon the larvæ, since the latter do
not represent an older phyletic stage of the
species, but must have arisen contemporaneously
with this last stage. The enormous structural
difference between the larvæ and the imagines is
not explained by the latter having arisen from the
former supplementarily as a finished production,
but by both having been contemporaneously
adapted to continually diverging conditions of
<span class="locked">life.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> Considered phyletically, these larvæ are by
no means necessarily transitional to the origination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
of the flies. They could have been quite different
without the form of the imagines having been
thereby modified, since the stages of insect metamorphosis
vary independently of each other in
accordance with the conditions of life to which
they are subjected, and exert scarcely any, or only
a very small form-determining influence upon each
other, as has been amply proved in the preceding
essay. In any case the power of these larvæ (the
<i>Cecidomyiæ</i>) to propagate themselves asexually
was first acquired as a secondary character, as
appears from the fact that there exist numerous
species of the same genus which do not “nurse.”
In the form which they now possess they could
never have played the part of the final stage of
the ontogeny, nor could they formerly have possessed
the power of sexual <span class="locked">reproduction.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> In
brief, we are here concerned with true larval reproduction,
whilst in Triton we have reversion to
an older phyletic <span class="locked">stage.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot agree with my friend Professor Haeckel
when he occasionally designates the reversion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
the Tritons as an “adaptation” to a purely aqueous
<span class="locked">existence.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span> We could here only speak of “adaptation”
if we took the word in a quite different sense
to that in which it was first introduced into
science by Darwin and Wallace. These naturalists
thereby designate a gradual bodily transformation
appearing in the course of generations in correspondence
with the new requirements of altered
conditions of life or, in other words, the action of
natural selection, and not the result of a suddenly
and direct acting transforming cause exerted but
once on a generation.</p>

<p>Just because the word “adaptation” can be
used in ordinary language in many senses, it is
desirable that it should have only <i>one</i> precise signification,
and above all that we should not speak
of adaptation where scarcely any morphological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>
change occurs, but only a kind of functional
change in the sense used by <span class="locked">Dohrn.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> This is the
case for example, when <span class="locked">Forel<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span> shows that fresh
water Pulmonifera, the organization of which is
attributed to the direct respiration of air, can
nevertheless become settled in the greatest depths
of mountain lakes through their lungs being again
employed as gills. That not the least change in
the lungs hereby takes place is shown by the
observations of Von <span class="locked">Siebold,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> who saw the shallow
water Pulmonifera using their lungs alternately
for direct aërial and aquatic respiration, according
to the amount of air contained in the water. If
with Von Siebold we merely apply the word
“adaptation” to such cases, this expression would
lose the special sense which it originally conveyed,
and the word would have to be abandoned as a
<i>terminus technicus</i>; still, such cases may perhaps
be spoken of as <i>physiological</i> adaptation.</p>

<p>In any case the reproductive “larvæ” of the
Tritons as little present a case of true adaptation
as the Axolotl, which occasionally becomes transformed
into an Amblystoma. In both cases the
transformation referred to is by no means indispensable
to the life of the individual. Mature Tritons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
(devoid of gills) can exist, as I have myself seen, for
many months, and probably also for a year in deep
water, although adapted for purely pulmonary
respiration; whilst Axolotls, as I have already mentioned,
can live well for a year in shallow water
poor in air. If their gills by this means become
shrivelled up or completely disappear, even this is
not adaptation in the Darwinian sense, but the
effect of directly acting external influences, and
chiefly of diminished use.</p>

<p>A case entirely analagous to that of Filippi’s
was observed by Jullien in 1869. Four female larvæ
of <i>Lissotriton Punctatus</i> (Bell)&mdash;(synonymous
with <i>Triton Tæniatus</i>, Schnd.), taken from a pool,
proved to be sexually mature. They contained
mature eggs in their ovaria ready for laying, and
two of them actually deposited eggs. Four male
larvæ found in the same pool, appeared to be
equally developed with respect to size, but their
testicles contained no free spermatozoa, but only
<span class="locked">sperm-cells.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span></p>

<p>I have met with a third case of a similar kind
mentioned by Leydig in his memoir, rich in interesting
details, “on the tailed Amphibians of
the Wurtemburg <span class="locked">fauna.”<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span> Schreibers, the former
director of the Vienna Museum, also found
“larvæ” of Tritons with well-developed gills, but
of the size of the “adult male individuals,” and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
as shown by anatomical investigation, with well
“developed sexual organs,” the ovaria especially
being distended with eggs.</p>

<p>It is thus established that species which long
ago reached the salamander stage in phyletic
development, may occasionally degenerate to the
perennibranchiate stage. This fact obviously
makes my conception of the Axolotl as a reversion
form appear much less paradoxical&mdash;indeed, the
cases of reversion in Triton are precisely analagous
to the process which I suppose to have taken
place in the Axolotl. We have only to substitute
Amblystomas for Tritons, to imagine the pool in
which De Filippi found his “sexually mature Triton
larvæ” enlarged to the size of the Lake of Mexico,
and to conceive the unknown, and perhaps here
transitory, causes of the reversion to be permanent,
and we have all that is necessary, so far as
we at present know, for the restoration of the
Axolotl; we obtain a perennibranchiate population
of the lake.</p>

<p>It has not yet been determined whether the
perennibranchiate form of the Triton actually prevailed
permanently in De Filippi’s pool, since, so
far as I know, this has not since been examined.</p>

<p>Let us, however, assume for an instant that this
is really the case, and that there exists at that
spot a colony of sexually reproductive perennibranchiate
Tritons: should we wonder if a true
Triton occasionally appeared among their progeny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
or if we were able to induce the majority of the
individuals of this brood to become metamorphosed
into Tritons by keeping them in shallow water?
According to my view this is precisely the case of
the Mexican Axolotl.</p>

<p>I need not, however, restrict myself to this in
order to support my hypothesis, but must also
directly combat the view hitherto received, since
the latter is in contradiction with facts.</p>

<p>Did there really exist in the Axolotl a tendency
to sudden phyletic advancement, then one fact
would remain quite incomprehensible, viz. the
sterility of the Amblystomas.</p>

<p>Out of about thirty Amblystomas obtained by
Duméril down to the year 1870, there was not one
in a state of sexual maturity; neither copulation
nor deposition of eggs took place, and the anatomical
investigation of single specimens showed that
the eggs were immature, and that the spermatozoa,
although present, were without the undulating membrane
characteristic of the salamanders, but were
not devoid of all power of movement, only, as established
by Quatrefages, were “incompletely <span class="locked">motile.”<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span></p>

<p>So also the five Amblystomas about which I
have been writing, show up to the present time no
appearance of reproduction.</p>

<p>The objection raised by <span class="locked">Sacc,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span> that the sterility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
of the Amblystomas bred from Axolotls is attributable
to “bad nourishment,” is obviously of
but little avail. How is it that the Axolotls, which
are fed in a precisely similar manner, propagate so
readily? Moreover, I am able to expressly assert
that my Amblystomas were very well fed. It is
true that they have as yet scarcely reached the
age of two years, but the Axolotl propagates
freely in the second year, and some of Duméril’s
Amblystomas were five years old in 1870.</p>

<p>This fact of the sterility is strongly opposed to
the idea that these Amblystomas are the regular
precursors of the phyletically advancing genus
<i>Siredon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> I will by no means assert that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
theory of reversion actually explains the sterility,
but it is at least not directly opposed to it. Mere
reversion forms may die off without propagating
themselves; but a <i>new form</i> called forth by the
action of a phyletic vital force should not be sterile,
because this is the precise “aim” which the vital
force had in view. The conception of a vital force
comprises that of teleology.</p>

<p>The sterility of Amblystoma moreover, although
not completely explicable from our standpoint, can
be shown to be a phenomenon not entirely isolated.
In the above mentioned case of <i>Lissotriton Punctatus</i>,
the female “larvæ” were certainly sexually
mature and laid eggs, but the males of the same
period contained in their testicles no fully developed
spermatozoa.</p>

<p>Other cases of this kind are unknown to me;
at the time when I made the experiments with
butterflies already recorded (see the first essay),
this point of view was remote, and I therefore
neglected to examine the artificially bred reversion
forms with respect to their organs of reproduction.
But general considerations lead to the supposition
that atavistic forms may easily remain sterile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span></p>

<p>Darwin<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> finds the proximate causes of sterility
in the first place in the action of widely diverging
conditions of life, and in the next place in the
crossing of individuals widely different in constitution.
Now it is certainly deviating conditions of
life which lead to the metamorphosis of the Axolotl,
and from this point of view it cannot be surprising
if we find those individuals sterile which show
themselves so especially affected by these changed
conditions as to revert to the salamander form.</p>

<p>By this it is not in any way meant to be asserted
that reversion is invariably accompanied by sterility,
and one cannot raise as an objection to my interpretation
of the metamorphosis of the Axolotl, that
a reproductive colony of Axolotls could never have
arisen by reversion. On the contrary, Jullien’s
egg-depositing female Triton larvæ show that also
with reversion the power of reproduction may be
completely <span class="locked">preserved.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> From the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
general causes of sterility, it may even be inferred
that fertility can be lost in different degrees, and it
can be further understood to a certain extent why
this fertility is more completely lost by reversion
to the Amblystoma, than by the reversion of the
Triton to the perennibranchiate form.</p>

<p>If in these cases the reversion is brought about
by a change in the conditions of life, we may
perhaps suppose that the magnitude of this change
would determine the degree of fertility, and the
preservation of the reversion form. Still more,
however, would the fertility be influenced by the
extent of the morphological difference resulting
from the reversion. We know that the blending
of very different constitutions (<i>e.g.</i> the crossing of
different species) produces sterility. Something
similar results from the sudden reversion to a stage
of development widely different in its whole
structure. Here also we have in a certain sense
the union of two very different constitutions in one
individual&mdash;a kind of crossing.</p>

<p>From this point of view it can in some measure
be comprehended why sterility may be a result of
reversion; on the other hand, we thereby obtain no
explanation why, with the same amount of morphological
difference, in one case complete sterility, and
in another relative fertility occurs. The morphological
difference between Axolotl and Amblystoma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
is exactly the same as between Triton and its
“sexually mature larva;” the difference between
the two cases of reversion depends entirely upon
the direction of the leap, that taken in the former
case being precisely opposite in direction to that
taken in the latter.</p>

<p>Herein might be sought the explanation of the
different strength with which the reproductive
power is affected; not indeed in the direction of
the leap itself, but in the differences in the ontogeny
which are determined by the differences in the
direction of the leap. The reversion of the
Triton to an older phyletic stage coincides with
the arrest at a younger ontogenetic stage; or, in
other words, the older stage of the phylogeny to
which reversion takes place is still entirely
comprised in the ontogeny of each individual.
Each Triton is perennibranchiate throughout a
long period of its life; the reverting individual
simply reverts to the older phyletic stage by
remaining at the larval stage of its individual
development.</p>

<p>But it is quite different with the reversion of the
Axolotl to the formerly acquired, but long since
abandoned Amblystoma form. This is not retained
in the ontogeny of Axolotl, but has been completely
lost; for a long series of generations&mdash;so
must we suppose&mdash;the ontogeny has always only
attained to the perennibranchiate form. Now if at
the present time certain individuals were compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
to revert to the Amblystoma form, certainly no
greater leap would have been made from a morphological
point of view, than in the reversion of
Triton to the perennibranchiate form, but at the
same time the leap would be in another direction,
viz. over a long series of generations back to a form
which the species had not produced for a long period,
and which had to a certain extent become foreign
to it. We should thus have here also the grafting
of a widely different constitution upon that of the
Axolotl, or, if one prefers it, the commingling of
two widely different constitutions.</p>

<p>Of course I am far from wishing to pretend that
this “explanation” is exact; it is nothing more
than an attempt to point out the direction in which
the causes affecting the reproductive powers in
different degrees are to be looked for. A deeper
penetration into and special demonstration of the
manner in which these causes bring about such
results, must be reserved for a future period. For
the present it must suffice to have indicated that
there is an essential distinction between the two
kinds of reversion, and to have made it to some
extent comprehensible that this distinction may be
the determining impulse with respect to the question
of sterility. Perhaps the law here concealed from
us may one day be thus formulated:&mdash;Atavistic
individuals lose the power of reproduction the more
completely, the greater the number of generations
of their ancestors whose ontogeny no longer comprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
the phyletically older stage to which the
reversion takes place.</p>

<p>The hypothesis which interprets the transformation
of the Axolotl as a case of reversion, thus holds
out the possibility of our being able to comprehend
the sterility of the Amblystomas arising in this
manner, whilst, on the other hand, for the adherents
of a phyletic vital force, not only is this observed
sterility as Duméril expresses it “un véritable
énigme scientifique,” but an absolute paradox.
We should expect such a directive and inciting
principle to call into existence new forms having
vitality and not destined to perish, the more so
when it is concerned with a combination of
structural characters which, when originating in
another manner (viz. from other species of <i>Siredon</i>),
have long since shown themselves to have vitality
and reproductive power. We are indeed acquainted
with species of <i>Amblystoma</i> which propagate as
such, and each of which arises from an Axolotl-like
larva. Thus we cannot regard the sterile Amblystomas
produced by the Paris Axolotls as abortive
attempts of a vital force&mdash;an interpretation which
is certainly in itself already sufficiently rash.</p>

<p>Now if it be asked what change in the conditions
of life could have led to the reversion in the Lake
of <span class="locked">Mexico<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> of the Amblystoma to the Siredon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
form, I must admit that I can only offer a conjectural
reply, having but a conditional value so
long as it is not supported by a precise knowledge
of the conditions there obtaining, and of the habits
both of the Axolotl and of the Amblystoma.</p>

<p>It may be supposed generally that reversion is
brought about by the same external conditions as
those which formerly produced the perennibranchiate
stage. This supposition is in the first place
supported by the experiments here recorded, since
it is evidently the inducement to aërial respiration
which causes the young Axolotl to revert to the
Amblystoma form, <i>i.e.</i> the inciting cause under
whose domineering influence the Amblystoma form
must have arisen.</p>

<p>Here again the case is quite similar to that of
seasonally dimorphic butterflies. Reversion of
the summer brood to the winter form is there most
easily caused by the action of cold, <i>i.e.</i> by the
same influence as that under whose sway the winter
form was developed.</p>

<p>We know indeed that reversion may also arise
by the crossing of races and species, and I have
attempted to show that reversion in butterflies may
also be brought about by other influences than
cold; but still the most probable supposition
obviously is, that reversion would be caused by the
persistent action of the same influences as those
which in a certain sense created the perennibranchiate
form. That the latter was produced under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
the influence of an aquatic life there can be no
doubt, and thus, in accordance with my supposition,
the hypothetical <i>Amblystoma Mexicanum</i>, the
supposed ancestral form of the Axolotl of the
Mexican Lake, might have been caused to revert to
the perennibranchiate form by a reduction in the
possibilities of its living upon land, and by its being
compelled to frequent the water.</p>

<p>I will not here return to the consideration of
every other opinion <i>ab initio</i>. It is very advisable
to distinguish between the mere impulses which
are able to produce sudden reversion, and between
actual transforming causes which result directly or
indirectly in the remodelling of a species. Thus,
it is conceivable <i>à priori</i> that reversion may occur
by the action of an inciting cause having nothing
to do with the origin of the phyletically older form.
Temperature can certainly have played no part, or
only a very small part, in the formation of the
perennibranchiate form; nevertheless cold may
well have been one of the inciting causes which
induced the Amblystoma at one time to revert
to the <i>Siredon</i> form, and we cannot at present
consider De Saussure to be incorrect when he
maintains that the low temperature of the Mexican
winter might prevent that transformation (of the
Axolotl into the Amblystoma) which would occur
“in the warm reptile-house” of the Jardin des
Plantes. He supports this view by stating that
“Tschudi has found the Amblystoma” (of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
another species) “in the hottest parts of the United
States.” “On the Mexican plateau, however, it
snows every winter, and if the lake does not actually
freeze, its temperature must fall very considerably
in the shallowest parts.”</p>

<p>But although this view is not opposed by any
theoretical considerations, I still hold it to be incorrect.
I doubt whether it is temperature that
has brought about the reverse transformation of
the Amblystoma into the Axolotl, or which, according
to De Saussure’s conception, at the present
time prevents the transformation of the Axolotl in
the Lake of Mexico. I doubt this because Amblystomas
are now known from all parts of the United
States as far north as New York, a proof that a
winter cold considerably greater than that of the
Mexican plateau is no hindrance to the metamorphosis
of the Axolotl, and that the genus does not
show itself to be in this respect more sensitive than
our native genera of <i>Salamandridæ</i>.</p>

<p>The following observations of De Saussure, in
which he calls attention to the nature of the
Mexican Lake, appear to me to be more worthy of
consideration:&mdash;“The bottom of this lake is
shallow, and one passes imperceptibly from the
lake into extensive marshy regions before reaching
solid ground; perhaps this circumstance makes
the Axolotl incapable of reaching dry land, and
prevents the transformation.”</p>

<p>In any case the Lake of Mexico offers very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
peculiar conditions for Amphibian life. My
esteemed friend Dr. v. Frantzius has called my
attention to the fact that this lake&mdash;as well as many
other Mexican lakes&mdash;is slightly saline. At the
time of the conquest of Mexico by Ferdinand
Cortez, this circumstance led to the final surrender
of the city, as the Spaniards cut off the supply of
water to the besieged, and the water of the lake is
undrinkable. The ancient Mexicans had laid down
water-conduits from the distant mountains, and the
city is still supplied with water brought through
conduits.</p>

<p>Now this saltness cannot in itself be the cause
of the degeneration to the perennibranchiate form,
but it may well be so in combination with other
pecularities of the lake. The narrowest part of the
lake is the eastern, and it is only in this part that
the Axolotl lives. Now in winter, violent easterly
gales rush down from the mountains and blow
continuously, driving the water before them to such
an extent that it becomes heaped up in the western
portion of the lake, where it frequently causes
floods, whilst 2000 feet of the shallow eastern
shore are often laid completely <span class="locked">dry.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span></p>

<p>Now if we consider these two peculiarities, viz.
salineness and periodical drying up of a part of the
bottom of the lake through continuous gales, we
certainly have for the Axolotl, conditions of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
which are only to be found in few species. One
might certainly attempt to apply these facts in a
quite opposite sense, and to regard them as
unfavourable to my theory, since the retreat of the
water from a great portion of the bottom of the
lake would&mdash;so one might think&mdash;rather facilitate
transition to a life upon land, and indeed compel
the adoption of such a mode of existence. But
we should thus forget that the exposed bottom of
the lake is a sterile surface without food or place
of concealment, and, above all, without vegetation;
and further, that owing to the considerable salineness
of the water (specific gravity = 1.0215),<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> the
whole of the exposed surface must be incrusted
with salt, a circumstance which would render it
quite impossible for the creatures to feed upon
land. Sodic chloride and carbonate are dissolved
in the water in such considerable quantities, that
they are regularly deposited upon the shores of
the lake as a crust, which is collected during the
dry season of the year and sent into the market
under the name of “tequisquite” (Mühlenpfordt).<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>Thus the supposition is not wanting in support,
that peculiar conditions make it more difficult for
the creature to obtain its food upon land than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
the water, and this alone may have been sufficient
to have induced it to acquire the habits of a purely
aquatic existence, and thus to revert to the perennibranchiate
or Ichthyodeous form.</p>

<p>But enough of supposition. We must not complain
that we are unable from afar to discover with
precision the causes which compelled the Axolotl
to abandon the Amblystoma stage, as long as we
are not able to explain the much nearer cases of
reversion in Filippi’s and Jullien’s Tritons; nevertheless,
in these cases also, the causes affecting
the whole colony of Tritons must be general,
since&mdash;at least in the case noticed by Filippi&mdash;the
greater majority of the individuals remained in the
larval condition. Experiments with Triton larvæ
could throw greater light upon this subject; it
would have in the first place to be established
whether reversion could be artificially induced, and
if so, by what influences.</p>

<p>From the previously mentioned experiments with
butterflies, as well as from the results obtained with
Axolotls, we should expect that in Tritons, reversion
to the Ichthyodeous form would take place if we
allowed the inciting cause, viz. the bathing of the
gills and of the whole body with water, to act persistently,
and at the same time withheld that influence
under whose action the salamander form
became developed, viz. the bathing of the gills,
the skin, and the surfaces of the lungs with air.</p>

<p>Old experiments of this kind are to be met with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
but they were never carried on for a sufficient time
to entirely allay the suspicion, that the specimens
concerned would perhaps have undergone the
ordinary metamorphosis if their existence had been
prolonged.</p>

<p>Thus, <span class="locked">Schreibers<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> relates that “by confining
tadpoles of the salamander found at large in their
last stage of growth, under water by means of an
arrangement (net?), and feeding them with finely
chopped earthworms, he was able to keep them for
several months&mdash;and indeed throughout the winter&mdash;in
this condition, and in this way to forcibly defer
their final change, and their transition from the tadpole
stage to that of the perfected creature during
this period.” It is not stated whether the animals
finally underwent transformation, so that it cannot be
decided whether we have here a case of reversion
or simply one of retarded development. That
metamorphosis may occur after a long period of
time, is shown by experiments upon the tadpole
of <i>Pelobates</i> conducted by Professor Langer in
<span class="locked">Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> The creatures were kept in deep water
in such a manner that they were not able to land,
and by this means three out of a large number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
of individuals had their metamorphosis delayed
till the second summer; notwithstanding this,
transformation then occurred.</p>

<p>It cannot be objected to my reversion hypothesis,
that it opposes on the one side what on the other
it postulates, viz. a <i>per saltum</i> change of structure.
Reversion is characterized by the sudden acquisition
of an older, <i>i.e.</i> a formerly existing phyletic
stage. That reversion occurs is a fact, whilst
nobody has hitherto been able to prove, or even to
make probable, that a stage of the future (<i>sit
venia verbo</i>) has been attained at once (<i>per
saltum</i>).</p>

<p>Now if it is possible to find influences in the
present conditions of life of the Axolotl which make
it difficult or quite impossible for it to live upon
land, and which therefore appear as incentives to
the reversion to the Ichthyodeous form, the other
portion of my hypothesis&mdash;the assumption that the
Axolotl had become an Amblystoma at a former
period&mdash;can also be supported by facts.</p>

<p>We know from <span class="locked">Humboldt<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span> that the level of
the Lake of Mexico at a comparatively recent
period was considerably higher than at present.
We know further that the Mexican plateau was
covered with forest, which has now been destroyed
wherever there are human, and especially Spanish
settlements. Now if we suppose that at some
post-glacial period the mountain forests extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span>
to the borders of the lake, at that time deep, with
precipitous sides and much less saline, not only
should we thus have presented different conditions
of life to those at present existing, but also such
as would be most favourable for the development
of a species of salamander.</p>

<p>On the whole, I believe that my attempt to
explain the exceptional metamorphosis of the
Axolotl of the Mexican lake cannot be objected to
as being a too airy phantasy. In any case it is the
only possible explanation which can be opposed to
that which supposes that the occasional transformation
of the Axolotl is not reversion, but an
attempt at advancement. This last assumption
must, in my judgment, be rejected on purely
theoretical grounds by those who hold that a
sudden transformation of a species, when connected
with adaptation to new conditions of life, is
inconceivable&mdash;by those who regard adaptation,
not as the sudden work of a magic power, but as
the end result of a long series of natural, although
minute and imperceptible causes.</p>

<p>If my interpretation of the facts be correct, there
arises certain consequences which I may here
briefly mention in conclusion.</p>

<p>First, with regard to more obvious results. If
<i>Siredon Mexicanus</i>, Shaw, only by occasional reversion
assumes the Amblystoma form, and never,
or only exceptionally, propagates as such, but only
as <i>Siredon</i>, the more recent systematists are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
justified in striking out the genus <i>Siredon</i> and in
placing <i>S. Mexicanus</i> as an undeveloped form in
the genus <i>Amblystoma</i>. So long as there exists
not one only, but several species of <i>Siredon</i> which
as such regularly propagate themselves, the genus
exists; and although we would not deprive systematists
of all hope of these species of <i>Siredon</i>
being one day re-elevated to <i>Amblystomæ</i>, it nevertheless
better accords with the actually existing
state of affairs if we allow the genus <i>Siredon</i> to
remain as before among the genera of <i>Salamandrina</i>,
and to include therein all those species
which, like the Paris Axolotl, <i>S. Mexicanus</i>, Shaw,
and probably also <i>S. Lichenoides</i>, Baird, only exceptionally,
or through artificial influences, assume
the Amblystoma form, but without propagating
regularly in this condition. On the other hand, we
should correctly comprise under the genus <i>Amblystoma</i>
all those species which propagate in this
state regularly, and in which the perennibranchiate
stage occurs only as a larval condition.</p>

<p>To arrive at a decision in single cases would
chiefly concern the American naturalists, whose
ever increasing activity may lead us to hope soon
for a closer investigation of the reproduction of
the numerous species of <i>Amblystoma</i> of their
native country. I should rejoice if the facts and
arguments which I have here offered should give
an impetus to such researches.</p>

<p>The second consequence to which I may refer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
is of a purely theoretical nature, and concerns a
corollary to the “fundamental biogenetic law”
first enunciated by Fritz Müller and Haeckel.
This, as is well known, consists of the following
law:&mdash;The ontogeny comprises the phylogeny,
more or less compressed and more or less modified.</p>

<p>Now according to this law, each step in phyletic
development when replaced by a later one, must
remain preserved in the ontogeny, and must therefore
appear at the present time as an ontogenetic
stage in the development of each individual. But
my interpretation of the transformation of the
Axolotl appears to stand in contradiction to this,
since the Axolotl, which at a former period was an
Amblystoma, retains nothing of the latter in its
ontogeny. The contradiction is, however, only
apparent. As long as we are concerned with an
actual advance in development, and therefore with
the attainment of a new step never formerly
reached, the older stages will be found in the
ontogeny. But this is not the case when the new
stage is not an actual novelty, but formerly represented
the final stage of the individual development;
or, in other words, when we are concerned
with the reversion, not of single individuals, but of
the species as such, to the preceding phyletic
stage, <i>i.e.</i> with a phyletic degeneration of the
species. In this case the former end-stage of the
ontogeny would be simply eliminated, and we
should then only be able to recognize its former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
existence by its occasional appearance in a reversion
form. Thus, under certain conditions the
Triton sinks back to the perennibranchiate stage;
not in such a manner that the individual first
becomes a Triton and then undergoes perennibranchiate
re-modification, but simply, as I have
already shown above, by its remaining at the
Ichthyodeous stage and no longer attaining to the
Salamander form. So also, according to my
hypothesis, the salamandrine <i>Amblystoma Mexicanum</i>,
formerly inhabiting the shores of the
Lake of Mexico, has degenerated to the perennibranchiate
stage, and the only trace that remains
to us of its former developmental status is the
tendency, more or less retained in each individual,
to again ascend to the salamander stage under
favourable conditions.</p>

<p>The third and last consequence which my interpretation
of the facts entails, is the change in
the part played by reversion in organic nature.
Whilst atavistic forms have hitherto been known
only as isolated and exceptional cases, interesting
indeed in the highest degree, but devoid of significance
in the course of the development of organic
nature, a real importance in this last respect
must now be attached to them.</p>

<p>I may assume that reversion can in two ways
be effectual for the preservation or re-establishment
of a living form. In the first place, where,
as in Axolotl, the new and organically higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
form becomes untenable through external influences,
instead of simply perishing&mdash;since advancement
in another direction does not appear to
be possible&mdash;a reversion of the species to the
older and more lowly organized stage occurs. In
the second place, the older phyletic form may
not be abandoned while a newer form is being
developed therefrom, but the former may alternate
with the latter, as we see in the case of seasonally
dimorphic butterflies. It can hardly be objected
if I regard the alternation of the summer and
winter form in this case as a periodic reversion to
the phyletically older (winter) form.</p>

<p>Although the reversion of an entire species,
such as I suppose to have been the case with the
Axolotl, may be of rare occurrence, this is certainly
not the case with periodic or cyclical reversion;
the latter plays a very important part in
the development of the various forms of alternating
or cyclical <span class="locked">propagation.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span></h4>

<p>In the previous portion of this essay it was
pointed out that the causes to which I attributed
the reversion of the hypothetical <i>Amblystoma
Mexicanum</i> to the existing Axolotl, did not appear
to me to amount to a complete explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
of the phenomenon. In the first place these
seemed to me too local, since they could only be
applied with any certainty to the Axolotl of the
lake of the Mexican capital, whilst the Paris
Axolotls obtained from other parts of Mexico
still required an explanation. On the other hand,
these causes did not appear to me sufficiently
cogent. Should we even learn subsequently that
the Paris Axolotl is also derived from a salt lake
which is exposed to similar winds to the Lake of
Mexico, we still have in this peculiarity of the
lakes only a cause tending to make it difficult for
the larva to undergo metamorphosis, and to reach
a suitable new habitat on the land. The impossibility
of doing this, or the complete absence of
such habitat, does not however follow as a necessary
consequence.</p>

<p>It would obviously be a much more solid support
for my hypothesis if it were possible to point
to some physical conditions of the land which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
there precluded the possibility of the existence of
Amblystomas.</p>

<p>For a long time I was indeed unable to discover
such causes, and I therefore concluded the previous
portion of this essay and went to press.
Afterwards, when residing in one of the highest
valleys of our Alps in the Upper Engadine, an
idea accidentally occurred to me, which I do not
now hesitate to regard as correct after having
tested it by known facts.</p>

<p>It happens that in the Upper Engadine there
live only such Amphibia as persistently, or at
least frequently resort to the water. I found
frogs up to nearly 7000 feet above the sea, and
Tritons at 6000 feet (Pontresina and Upper
Samaden). On the other hand, the land-living
mountain salamander, <i>S. Atra</i>,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> was absent, although
suitable stations for this species were
everywhere present, and it would have wanted for
food as little as do its allies the water-newts.
Neither would the great elevation above the sea
offer any obstacle to its occurrence, since it occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
ascends to a height of 3000 metres
(Fatiot).<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>Now it is well known that the atmosphere of
the Upper <span class="locked">Engadine,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span> like that of other elevated
Alpine valleys enclosed by extensive glaciers, is
often extraordinarily dry for a long period, a condition
which appears to me to explain why the
black land-salamander is there <span class="locked">absent,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span> whilst its
near water-living ally occurs in large numbers.
The skin of the naked Amphibia generally requires
moisture, or else it dries up, and the creature is
deprived of a necessary breathing apparatus, and
often dies as rapidly as though some important
internal organ had been removed. Decapitated
frogs hop about for a long time, but a frog which
escapes from a conservatory and wanders about
for one night in the dry air of a room, is found the
following day with dry and dusty skin half dead in
some nook, and perhaps perishes in the course of
another day if left without moisture.</p>

<p>All that we know of the biology of the Amphibia
is in accordance with this. Thus, all the land-salamanders
of southern Italy avoid the hot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
dry air of summer by burying in the ground, where
they undergo a summer sleep. This is the case
with the interesting <i>Salamandrina Perspicillata</i>,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
and with the land-living Sardinian Triton, the
remarkable <i>Euproctus Rusconii</i>, Gené,<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> (<i>Triton
Platycephalus</i>, Schreiber). With respect to <i>Geotriton
Fuscus</i> I learn from Dr. Wiedersheim, who
has studied the life conditions of this, the lowest
European Urodelan, in its own habitat, that in
Sardinia it sleeps uninterruptedly from June till
the winter; whilst on the coast of Spezia and at
Carrara, where it also occurs, it avoids the summer
sleep in a very peculiar manner. It makes use of
the numerous holes in the calcareous formation of
that region, and for some months in the year
becomes a cave-dweller. As soon as the great
heat occurs, often in May, it withdraws into the
holes, and again emerges in November during the
wet weather. In these lurking holes it does not
fall into a sleep, but is found quite active, and
its stomach, filled chiefly with scorpions, shows
that it goes successfully in search of food; the
moist air of the holes makes it unnecessary for it
to bury in the earth.</p>

<p>In the same sense it appears to me must be
conceived the fact that the solitary species of frog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
of the Upper Engadine, <i>Rana Temporaria</i>,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> the
brown grass frog, is there much more a frequenter
of the water than in the plains. It is true that I
can find no remark to this effect in the excellent
work of Fatiot, already referred to above, and I
am therefore obliged to resort to my own observations,
which, although often repeated, have always
been carried on for only a short time. I was
much struck with the circumstance that the Engadine
frogs were to be found in numbers in the
water long after the pairing season, which, according
to Fatiot, lasts at most to the end of June.
In the numerous pools around Samaden I found
them in July and August, whilst in the plains they
only take to the water at the time of reproduction,
and seek winter quarters in the mud on the first
arrival of this season. (Fatiot, p. 321.) In the
Engadine they have therefore in some measure
adopted the mode of life of the aquatic frogs, but
this of course does not prevent them from returning
in damp weather to their old habits and
roving through meadows and woods.</p>

<p>After these considerations had made it appear
to me very probable that the dry air of the Upper
Engadine accounted for the absence of the black
land-salamander, the question at once arose
whether the absence of Amblystomas from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
Mexican plateau might not perhaps be due to the
same cause, <i>i.e.</i> whether such a dryness of the
atmosphere might not perhaps prevail also in that
region, so that Amphibia, or at least salamander-like
Amphibia, could not long exist on the land.
The height above the sea is still greater (7000
to 8000 feet), and the tropical sun would more
rapidly dessicate everything in a country poor in
water.</p>

<p>As I was at the time without any books that
might have enlightened me on the meteorological
conditions of Mexico, I wrote to Dr. v. Frantzius,
who, by many years residence in Central America
was familiar with the climate of this region, and
solicited his opinion. I received the reply that
on the high plains of Mexico an extraordinary
dryness of the atmosphere certainly prevails.
“The main cause of the dryness of the high
plains is to be found in the geographical position,
the configuration of the land, and the
physical structure. The north-eastern trade-wind
drives the clouds against the mountains,
on the summits of which they deposit their
moisture, so that no vapour is carried over;
as long as the north-east trade-wind blows, the
streams feeding the rivers flowing into the Atlantic
Ocean are abundantly fed with water, whilst
on the western slopes, and especially on the high
plains, the clouds give no precipitation. In the
second half of the year also, during our summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
the so-called rainy season brings but little <span class="locked">rain<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span>&mdash;little
in comparison with the more southern regions,
where the heavy tropical thunderstorms daily
deluge the earth with water. Mexico lies much
too northerly, and does not reach the zone of
calms, within which region these tropical rains
are met with.”</p>

<p>Thus, in the high degree of dryness of the air
lasting throughout the year, I do not doubt that
we have the chief cause why no Amblystomas
occur on these elevated plains; they simply cannot
exist, and would become dried up if taken there,
supposing them not to be able to change their
mode of life and to take to the water. If therefore
in former times Amblystomas inhabited
Mexico, the coming on of the existing climatic
conditions left them only the alternative of becoming
extinct, or of again taking to the aquatic
life of their Ichthyodeous ancestors. That this
was not <i>directly</i> possible&mdash;that the Amblystoma
form was not able to become aquatic without a
change of structure, is shown by the fact that
even in the Lake of Mexico no Amblystoma
occurs. A retreat to an aqueous existence could,
as it appears, only be effected by complete reversion
to the Ichthyodeous form, which then also
took place.</p>

<p>But my hypothesis of the transformation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span>
Axolotl not only requires the proof that Amblystomas
cannot exist under present conditions in
Mexico, but also the further demonstration that at
a former period other conditions prevailed there,
and these of such a nature as to make the
existence of land-salamanders possible.</p>

<p>With respect to my question, whether we might
not perhaps assume that at some post-glacial
period the conditions of atmospheric moisture on
the high plains of Mexico were essentially different
from those at present prevailing, I recollected Dr.
v. Frantzius and the above-quoted observation of
<span class="locked">Humboldt’s,<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span> who discovered in the neighbourhood
of the Lake of Tezenco (Mexico) distinct
evidence of a much higher former level of the
water. “All such elevated plains were certainly
at a former period so many extensive water-basins,
which gradually became filled, and are still filling
up with detritus. The evaporation from such
large surfaces of water must at that time have
caused a very moist atmosphere, favourable to
vegetation and adapted for the life of naked
Amphibia.”</p>

<p>From this side also my hypothesis thus receives
support, and we may assume with some certainty
that at the beginning of the diluvial <span class="locked">period<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
woods surrounding the Mexican lakes were inhabited
by Amblystomas, which, as the lakes subsequently
became more and more dried up and the
air continually lost moisture, found it more difficult
to exist on the land. They would at length
have completely died out, had they not again
become aquatic by reversion to the Ichthyodeous
form. It may perhaps be supposed that the
above-mentioned physical conditions&mdash;desolate,
salt-incrusted shores&mdash;co-operated in the production
of the reversion, by making it difficult for
the larvæ to quit the water; but we can only judge
with certainty upon this point when, by means of
experiment, we have discovered the causes which
produce reversion in the Amphibia.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Addendum.</span></h4>

<p>I have lately met with another interesting
notice on the reproduction of the native North
American Amblystomas. Professor Spence F.
Baird, of Washington, has often observed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
development from the egg of various species, and
especially of <i>Amblystoma Punctatum</i> and <i>A. Fasciatum</i>.
His observations do not appear to be as
yet published, so that I was unable to discover
any account of the development of <i>Amblystoma</i> in
existing <span class="locked">literature.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span> I am authorized to extract
the following brief data from a letter addressed to
Dr. v. Frantzius.</p>

<p>In order to deposit their eggs the Amblystomas
go into the water, where the eggs are laid enclosed
in a jelly-like mass, but never more than fifteen to
twenty together. The spherical eggs are very
large, perhaps a quarter of an inch in diameter.
They soon develop into a <i>Siredon</i>-like larva, which
remains several months in this condition. The
gills then shrivel up, the creature begins to crawl,
and gradually passes through the different transformations
to the complete Amblystoma form.</p>

<p>It appears from this communication that the
Amblystomas lay much larger and much fewer
eggs than the Axolotl, and that their development
throughout resembles that of our salamanders.</p>

<p>In concluding I may mention an anatomical
fact which most strongly supports my view that
the Mexican Axolotl is a reverted Amblystoma.
I learn from Dr. Wiedersheim that the Axolotl
possesses the “intermaxillary gland” which occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
in all the land Amphibia. This organ, lying in the
intermaxillary cavity, appears, whenever it occurs,
to produce a kind of birdlime, <i>i.e.</i> a very glutinous
secretion, which serves to attach the prey to
the rapidly protrusible tongue. Although this
secretion may perhaps also have another function,
from the absence of the intermaxillary gland in all
exclusively aquatic Amphibia, it follows that it
must be devoid of importance for, and inapplicable
to feeding in the water. The intermaxillary gland
is absent in all <i>Perennibranchiata</i> and <i>Derotremata</i>
which Wiedersheim has hitherto investigated,
viz. in <i>Menobranchus</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Siren</i>,
<i>Cryptobranchus</i>, <i>Amphiuma</i>, and <i>Menopoma</i>, all
of which are indeed without the cavity in which
the gland is situated in the <i>Salamandrina</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
the <i>cavum intermaxillare</i>.</p>

<p>Now in the <i>Salamandrina</i> the gland appears
at an early stage. It is possessed in a well-developed
state by the larvæ both of species of
<i>Triton</i> and of <i>Amblystoma</i>, where indeed the
glandular structure completely fills the <i>cavum
intermaxillare</i>.</p>

<p>Were the Axolotl a species retarded in phyletic
development, the presence of a gland which does
not occur in any other <i>Perennibranchiata</i>, and
which is only of use for life upon land, would be
quite inexplicable.</p>

<p>The matter becomes still more enigmatical
through the fact that the gland, although present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
is quite rudimentary. Whilst in the <i>Salamandrina</i>
the capacious intermaxillary cavity is entirely
filled by the tubes of the gland in question,
in Axolotl this cavity is almost completely filled
with a closely woven connective tissue, in which
there can only be found a small number of gland-tubes&mdash;in
the extreme front, and at the base immediately
over the intermaxillary teeth&mdash;these
tubes agreeing in the details of their histological
structure with the elements of the same gland
in the <i>Salamandridæ</i>.</p>

<p>I give these anatomical details from Dr.
Wiedersheim’s verbal communication. An amplified
account will subsequently appear in another
<span class="locked">place.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span></p>

<p>An explanation of this rudimentary intermaxillary
gland in the Axolotl only appears to me possible
on the supposition that the latter is an atavistic
form. From this point of view it is evident that
the gland already present in all <i>Amblystoma</i>-larvæ
must have been taken over by the perennibranchiate
form of the existing Axolotl, through
the reversion of the hypothetical <i>Amblystoma
Mexicanum</i> of the “diluvial <span class="locked">period.”<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> It can
also be easily understood that this organ would
become more and more rudimentary in the course
of time, since it has no further use in the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
and the gap thus arising in the formerly present
<i>cavum intermaxillare</i> would become filled with
connective tissue.</p>

<p>While the German edition of this work was
going through the press I obtained, through the
kindness of my friend Dr. Emil Bessels of
Washington, the Mexican memoir upon the new
<span class="locked">Axolotl,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> which even in Mexico regularly, or at
least in many cases, becomes developed into the
Amblystoma form.</p>

<p>The facts are briefly as follows:&mdash;The small
Lake of Santa Isabel is some hours’ journey from
the Mexican capital. In this lake there lives a
species of Axolotl which had hitherto remained
unknown, and was described by Señor Velasco as
<i>Siredon Tigrinus</i>. This species propagates itself
indeed in the Axolotl state, but in many cases it
becomes transformed into Amblystoma and takes
to the land. Although propagation in the Amblystoma
condition was not observed, it can hardly be
doubted that it also propagates in this form.</p>

<p>At first sight these facts appear to refute my
hypothesis, that the extreme dryness of the air of
the Mexican plateau precludes the existence of
land Amphibia. Nevertheless I do not abandon
this hypothesis for the former one, since a closer
study of the data furnished by Velasco confirms
rather than refutes my supposition.</p>

<p>Velasco expressly corroborates the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
that the Axolotl hitherto known from the great
Mexican lake which never dries up (Lake of
Xochimilco and Chalco), is only met with in its
native habitat in the <i>Siredon</i> form, <i>i.e.</i> as <i>Siredon
Humboldtii</i>. According to Velasco the cause of
the frequent assumption of the Amblystoma form
by the new <i>Siredon Tigrinus</i>, is to be found in the
local conditions of life of this species. The Lake
Santa Isabel is shallow, its greatest depth amounting
to three meters, and it is liable to a periodical
drying up, which is so complete that one can pass
dry-shod through it in several places. The species
must therefore have long since died out had it
not been able to adapt itself periodically to a
land life. Now it could have become transformed
into a land Amphibian&mdash;as Señor Velasco observed&mdash;at
various stages of growth; and indeed
this author believes that “the Creator has implanted
an instinct in this creature,” which enables
it to always undergo metamorphosis at the right
time.</p>

<p>This last assumption may or may not be taken
as correct, but this much is established, viz. that
numerous individuals of this species take to the
land, and remain there during a period of many
months.</p>

<p>But does this contain the proof that salamander-like
animals are actually able to lead a land life in
Mexico&mdash;that the dry air is advantageous, or at
least supportable to them? It does not appear so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span>
to me, but rather that all which has been reported
of this Amblystoma by Señor Velasco goes to
show that the animal does not, properly speaking,
live upon land like the North American Amblystomas,
or like our land-salamanders, but that <i>it
only experiences a summer sleep lasting over the
period of drought</i>. These Amblystomas were
observed as they left the dried-up lake at night in
order to seek some moist lurking-place in the
neighbourhood, where they might remain concealed.
They are only known in the villages
situated near the lake, and were only seen there at
large just when they were wandering from the lake
to their place of concealment. At other times
they were mostly found in the earth, buried under
walls, the pavement of the market-place, &amp;c.
When laying down a line of railway, a workman
found in the earth a whole nest of twelve Amblystomas
lying close together. All these are not
mere lurking-holes which could be abandoned at
any moment; it would rather appear that we have
here places of refuge for the entire duration of the
period of drought, and that these would only be
forsaken when the water of the rainy season penetrated
the soil. I am not myself in a favourable
position for investigating these suppositions more
closely, but this could be done by Señor Velasco,
who lives in Mexico, and science would be much
indebted to him if he would examine as precisely
as possible into the habits and conditions of life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
this, and of the other species of Mexican Axolotls.
Unfortunately this gentleman can, it would appear,
have seen only the French publications upon
the transformation of the Axolotl, and could not
therefore have asked himself questions arising
from my conception of the facts; otherwise many
of his observations would have led to more definite
results. The above conclusion can however be
still further supported by Señor Velasco’s data.</p>

<p>One might indeed insist that with us also the
land-salamanders conceal themselves in moist
places during dry weather, and often lie hidden,
as in Mexico, in a hole, in a cluster of as many as
ten together; but with us they leave their lurking-place
from time to time and go in search of food.
Señor Velasco mentions nothing with respect to
this. What especially struck me was the statement
that the Mexican Amblystomas <i>were also to
be found in the water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> When Lake Santa Isabel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
is drained, the fishermen stretch large nets across
the exit channels, and in these they not only find
ordinary Axolotls, but also some “<i>sin aretes</i>,”
which they also designate “<i>mochos</i>,” <i>i.e.</i> hornless
Axolotls, because they have no gills, but have
already reached the Amblystoma stage. Our
land-salamanders live in the water only as larvæ,
but they also love and require moisture. Only the
female enters the water when she wants to deposit
her young (eggs with mature larvæ), and then only
at the margin of shallow pools or small brooks.
The Mexican Amblystoma thus much more resembles
in its habits our water-salamanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
(Tritons), which remain in the water at least during
the whole period of reproduction. These also
leave the water later, and, like the land-salamander,
seek concealment in the earth. They have this
habit also in those districts which possess a very
dry atmosphere; and especially in the Engadine,
where I first conceived the idea of taking into
account the dryness of the air, I found in the
pools at the end of August and the beginning of
September only larvæ of Tritons. The older
Amphibians must therefore have been on the land,
presumably in their places of winter concealment.</p>

<p>From what we have hitherto learnt from Señor
Velasco, the mode of life of <i>Amblystoma Tigrinum</i>
must resemble that of our Tritons, although its
structure is that of a land-salamander. I would
thus offer the following explanation of the facts at
present known:&mdash;Owing to the periodic drying up
of the lake of Santa Isabel, the <i>Siredon Tigrinus</i>
would be again compelled to undergo metamorphosis.
Whether this was formerly entirely
abandoned, or whether it always occurred in solitary
individuals, is almost immaterial; in any case the
habit of metamorphosis must have been very
rapidly acquired through natural selection, and
must have again become general, if the faculty
was only present in the species, although latent.
Through the dryness of the air, the Amblystomas
that had taken to the land would be compelled to
bury themselves at once, and to remain asleep till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a></span>
the recurrence of the rainy season, when they
would hasten back into the water and would there
live as a species of Triton.</p>

<p>Now one might feel inclined to ask why the
species of the great Mexican lake has not also
taken to this mode of life. To this it may be
simply replied that the water of this lake never
dries up, and that the Axolotls have thus never
been reduced to the alternative of undergoing
metamorphosis or of perishing. If therefore the
conditions of existence in water were more favourable
than on land, the tendency to abandon metamorphosis
would increase from generation to
generation, and the deportment at present observed
would finally result, <i>i.e.</i> propagation would
take place exclusively in the Axolotl state. As
has already been mentioned above, the latest
observations of Velasco furnish further confirmation
that the Axolotl of the great lake is never
met with in the Amblystoma condition, “although
it (the Axolotl) is brought daily from Mexico
into the market throughout the whole year.” I
should not however regard it as a refutation of
my view if prolonged investigation should show
that this species also (<i>Siredon Humboldtii</i>) occasionally
developed into an Amblystoma; on the
contrary, it would not at all surprise me if such
cases of reversion occurred in Mexico as well as
in Europe. The fact that an immense majority of
the Amphibians propagate in the Axolotl state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
would not be thereby affected, and would still
require an explanation: this I am still inclined to
see in the dryness of the air of the high plains,
which is so unfavourably adapted for a life passed
entirely on land.</p>

<span class="subhead">ON THE MECHANICAL CONCEPTION OF NATURE.</span></h3>

<hr />
<h4 id="P3-4-Intro">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>In the first of the three preceding essays it was
attempted to solve the question whether the transformations
of a given complex of characters in a
certain systematic group could be completely explained
by the sole aid of Darwinian principles.
It was attempted to trace the origin of the marking
and colouring of the Sphinx-caterpillars to individual
variability, to the influences of the environment,
and to the laws of correlation acting within
the organism. These principles as applied to the
origin of a certain well-defined, although narrowly
restricted range of forms, were tested in order to
see whether they were alone sufficient to explain
the transformation of the forms.</p>

<p>It appeared that this was certainly the case.
In all instances, or at least where the facts necessary
to obtain a complete insight were available,
the transformations could be traced to these
known factors; there remained no inexplicable
residual phenomena, and we therefore had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
reason for inferring the existence of some still
unknown modifying cause lying concealed in the
organism. In this region of the marking and
colouring of caterpillars, the assumption of a
phyletic vital force had to be abandoned, as being
superfluous for the explanation of the facts.</p>

<p>In the second essay the attempt was next made
with reference to double form-relationship, as presented
for observation in metamorphic insects, to
draw conclusions as to the causes of the transformations.
It appeared here that form- and
blood-relationship do not always coincide, since
the larvæ of a species, genus, or family, &amp;c., may
show quite different form-relationships to their
imagines. These facts alone told very decisively
against the existence of an internal developmental
power, so that the latter had likewise to be set
aside by the method of elimination, since the
observed incongruences as well as the congruences
of form-relationship, found sufficient
explanation in the action of the environment on
the organism.</p>

<p>This investigation thus also led to the denial of
a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>In the third essay I finally sought to prove
that the only case of transformation of one species
into another at present actually <span class="locked">observed<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span>, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
not without further evidence be interpreted as the
result of the action of a phyletic vital force, but
that more probably we had here only an apparent
case of new formation, which was in reality but a
reversion to a stage formerly in existence.</p>

<p>If this last investigation removes the only
certain observation which could have been adduced
in favour of the hypothesis of a phyletic
vital force, so also do the two former essays show
that this hypothesis, at least in the case of insects,
must be abandoned as inadequate.</p>

<p>The question now arises whether this conclusion,
based on such a limited range of inquiry,
can also be applied to the other groups of the
organic world without further evidence.</p>

<p>The supporters of a principle of organic development
will deny this in each individual case,
and will demand special proof for each group of
organisms; I believe this position, however, to be
incorrect. Here, if anywhere, it appears to me
justifiable to apply the conclusions inductively
from special cases to general ones, since I cannot
at all see why a power of such pre-eminent and
fundamental importance as a phyletic vital force
should have its activity limited to solitary groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
in the organic world. If such a power exists it
must be the inciting cause of organic development
in general, and must be equally necessary in
every part of creation, as no advancement could
take place without it. In this case, however, the
force would be recognizable and demonstrable at
every point; the phenomena should nowhere stand
in opposition to its admission, and should in no
case be explicable or comprehensible without it.
The same laws and forces which caused the development
of one group of forms must underlie
the development of the whole organic world.</p>

<p>I therefore believe that we are correct in applying
to the whole living world the results furnished
by the investigation of insects, and in thus
denying the existence of an innate metaphysical
developmental force.</p>

<p>There is, however, a quite distinct method
which leads to the same results, and to the preliminary,
if not to the complete and definitive
rejection of such a principle; <i>the admission of this
power is directly opposed to the laws of natural
science</i>, which forbid the assumption of <i>unknown</i>
forces as long as it is not demonstrated that
<i>known</i> forces are insufficient for the explanation
of the phenomena. Now nobody will assert that
this has in any case been proved; the test of
applying the known factors of transformation has
only just commenced, and wherever it has been
made they have proved sufficient as causal forces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span>
Thus, even without the foregoing special investigations
we should deny a phyletic vital force; the
more so as its admission is fraught with the
greatest consequences, since it involves a renunciation
of the possibility of comprehending
the organic world. We should, on this assumption,
at once cut ourselves off from all possible
mechanical explanation of organic nature, <i>i.e.</i>
from all explanation conformable to law. But
this signifies no less than the renunciation of all
further inquiry; for what is investigation in natural
science but the attempt to indicate the mechanism
through which the phenomena of the world are
brought about? Where this mechanism ceases
science is no longer possible, and transcendental
philosophy alone has a voice.</p>

<p>This conception represents very precisely the
well-known decision of Kant:&mdash;“Since we cannot
in any case know <i>à priori</i> to what extent the
mechanism of Nature serves as a means to every
final purpose in the latter, or how far the mechanical
explanation possible to us reaches,”
natural science must everywhere press the attempt
at mechanical explanation as far as possible.
This obligation of natural science will be conceded
even by those who lay great stress upon the necessity
for assuming a designing principle. Thus,
Karl Ernst von Baer states that we have no right
“to assert of the individual processes of Nature,
even when these evidently lead to a definite result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span>
that some Mind has originated them designedly.
The naturalist must always commence with details,
and may then afterwards ask whether the
totality of details leads him to a general and final
basis of intentional <span class="locked">design.”<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span></p>

<p>But even if we are precluded on these grounds
only from assuming the existence of a directive
power, <i>i.e.</i> a phyletic vital force, for explaining
detailed phenomena, and are at the same time
debarred from the possibility of arriving at a physical
or mechanical explanation&mdash;which amounts to
no less than the abandoning of the scientific
position&mdash;it certainly cannot be asserted that the
development of the organic world is already conceived
of as a mechanical process. We rather
acquiesce in the belief that the processes both of
organic and of inorganic nature depend most probably
upon purely causal powers, and that the
attempt to refer these to mechanical principles
should not therefore be abandoned. There is no
ground for renouncing the possibility of a mechanical
explanation, and the naturalist <i>must not</i>
therefore resign this possibility; for this reason he
cannot be permitted to assume a phyletic power so
long as it is not demonstrated that the phenomena
can never be understood without such an assumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be raised as an objection that even
for the explanation of individual life a vital power
was long ago admitted, as there was not then
sufficient material at hand to enable the phenomena
of life to be traced to physical forces. It
is now no longer questionable that this assumption
was a useless error&mdash;a false method&mdash;at the time
when made certainly very excusable, since the
aspect of the question was then, owing to the
imperfect basis of facts, very different to the
present analogous question as to the causes of
derivative development. Thus, although it is now
easy to prove this assumption to be erroneous, it
was in the former sense correct, as it was in
accordance with the existing state of knowledge.
At that time there was hardly one of the numerous
bridges which now connect inorganic with organic
nature, so that the supposition that life depended
upon forces which had no existence outside living
beings was sufficiently near.</p>

<p>In any case the philosophers of that period
cannot be blamed for filling up the gaps in the
existing knowledge by unknown powers, and in
this manner seeking to establish a finished system.
The task of philosophy is different to that of
natural science; the former strives at every period
to set up a completely finished representation of
the universe in accordance with the existing state
of knowledge. Natural science on the other hand
is only concerned in collecting this knowledge;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a></span>
she need not therefore always finish off, and
indeed can never close her account, since she will
never be in a position to solve all <span class="locked">problems.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> But
science must not for this reason pronounce any
question to be insoluble simply because it has not
yet been completely solved; this she does, however,
as soon as she renounces the possibility of
a mechanical explanation by invoking the aid of a
metaphysical principle.</p>

<p>That this is the correct mode of scientific
investigation is seen by the abandoning of the
(ontogenetic) vital force. The latter is no longer
admitted by anybody, now that we have turned
from mere speculation to the investigation of
Nature’s processes; nevertheless its non-existence
has not been demonstrated, nor are we yet in a
position to prove that all the phenomena of life
must be traced to purely physico-chemical processes,
to say nothing of our being actually able
to thus trace them. Von Baer also states “that
the abolishment of the vital force is an important
advance; it is the reduction of the phenomena of
life to physico-chemical processes, although these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
indeed still contain many gaps.” He points out
how very far we are still removed from being able
to reduce to physical causes, the processes through
which the fertilized yelk of an egg becomes developed
into a chicken.</p>

<p>How comes it therefore that we all have a conviction
that such a complete reduction will in time
become possible, or if not this, that the development
of the individual depends entirely upon the
same forces which are in operation without the
organism? For what reason have we rejected the
“vital force”?</p>

<p>Simply because we see no reason for assuming
that known forces are insufficient for explaining
the phenomena, and because we are not justified
in admitting directive forces as long as we have
any hope of one day furnishing a mechanical
explanation.</p>

<p>But if it is not only permissible, but even necessary,
to explain the <i>ontogenetic</i> vital power by
known forces, and to commence to indicate the
mechanism which produces the individual life,
why should it not be equally necessary to abandon
that assumption of a <i>phyletic</i> vital force which
stifles any deeper inquiry, and to attempt to point
out that here also the co-operation of mechanical
forces has brought about the multitudinous and
wonderful phenomena of the organic world?</p>

<p>The renunciation of the old vital force was
certainly an immediate consequence of the acquisition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">643</a></span>
of new facts&mdash;of the knowledge that the
same compounds which compose organic bodies
can be produced without the latter. This discovery,
due to Wöhler and his followers, showed
that organic products could be prepared <span class="locked">artificially.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span>
In brief, the decline of the vital force
followed from the knowledge that at least one
portion of the processes of life was governed by
known forces.</p>

<p>But in the domain of the development of the
organic world have we not quite analogous proofs
of the efficacy of known forces? Is not the
<i>variability</i> of all types of forms a fact? and
must not this under the action of natural selection
and heredity lead to permanent changes? Has
not the problem of explaining the subserviency of
all organic form to law as a <i>result</i> without invoking
its aid as a <i>principle</i> been thus successfully
solved? It is true that we have not directly
observed the process of natural selection from
beginning to end; neither has anybody directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
observed the mode in which the heat of the
animal body is generated by the processes of
combustion going on in the blood and in the
tissues; nevertheless, this is believed as a certainty,
and a “vital force” is not invoked.</p>

<p>Now the above-mentioned Darwinian principles
of transmutation are certainly not simple forces of
nature like those underlying the development of
the individual, <i>i.e.</i> chemico-physical forces, and
it cannot be said <i>à priori</i> whether in one of these
principles&mdash;perhaps in variability or in correlation&mdash;there
may not lie concealed a metaphysical
principle in addition to the physical
forces. In fact it has lately been asserted by
Edward von <span class="locked">Hartmann<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> that the theory of selection
is not a mechanical explanation, since it
combines forces which are only partly mechanical
and in part directive.</p>

<p>It must therefore be next investigated whether
this assertion is tenable.</p>

<span class="locked">naturalists.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span> He would be correctly classed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
those philosophers who have approached this
question with a many-sided scientific preparation.
It can nevertheless be perceived in his case how
difficult, and indeed how impossible, it is to estimate
the true value of the facts furnished by the
investigation of nature, when we attempt to take
up only the results themselves, without being
practised in the methods by which these are
reached, <i>i.e.</i> without being completely at home
in one of the scientific subjects concerned through
one’s own investigations. It appears to me that
the denial of the purely mechanical value of the
Darwinian factors of transformation arises in most
part from an erroneous classification of the scientific
facts with which we have to deal. There can
certainly be no mistake that the entire philosophical
conception of the universe, as laid down
by Von Hartmann in his “Philosophy of the Unconscious,”
is unfavourable to an unprejudiced estimate
of scientific facts and to their mechanical
valuation.</p>

<p>Variability, heredity, and above all correlation,
would not be regarded by Von Hartmann as purely
mechanical principles, but he would therein assume
a metaphysical directive principle.</p>

<p>In the first place, as regards variability, Von
Hartmann endeavours to show that it is only a
quite unlimited variability which suffices for the
explanation of necessary and useful adaptations
by means of selection and the struggle for existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
But this does not exist&mdash;variation rather
takes place in a fixed direction only (in Askenasy’s
sense), and this can be nothing else than the
expression of an innate law of development, <i>i.e.</i> a
phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>This deduction appears to me in two ways
erroneous. In the first place it is incorrect that
a quite unlimited variability is a postulate of the
theory of selection, and in the next place the
admission of variability, which is in a certain sense
“fixed in direction,” does not necessitate the
assumption of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>A mere unsettled variability, uniform in all
possible directions, is, according to Von Hartmann,
necessary for the theory of selection, because only
then does the variability offer a certain guarantee
“that under given conditions of life the variations
necessary for complete adaptation will not be
wanting.” But it is hereby overlooked that the
new life conditions to which the adaptation must
take place are as little fixed and unchangeable as
the organism itself. In such a case of transformation
we have not to deal with a type of organization
which was before fixed and immutable,
and which has to be squeezed into new life-conditions
as into a mould. The adaptation is not
one-sided, but mutual; a species in some measure
selects its new conditions of life, corresponding
with those possible to its organization, <i>i.e.</i> with
the variations actually occurring. I will choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
an instance which will even be conceded by Von
Hartmann as being only explicable by natural
selection, viz., a case of mimicry.</p>

<p>Supposing that among the South American
<i>Heliconiidæ</i> there occurred a species of <i>Pieris</i>
which had no resemblance to these protected
butterflies, either in form, marking, or colouring;
who can deny that it would be most useful to this
species to acquire the form and colouring of a
Heliconide, and thus, by taking to new conditions
of life, to avoid the persecutions of its foes? But
if the physical nature of the Pieride concerned
precluded the occurrence of Heliconoid variations,
would this incapability of insinuating itself into
these new conditions necessitate the decline of the
species? Could not its existence be secured in
some other manner? could not the destruction of
numerous individuals by foes be compensated for
by increased fertility? to say nothing of the
numerous other means through which the number
of surviving individuals might become increased,
and the existence of the species secured. This
case is not arbitrarily chosen; in the districts
where the <i>Heliconiidæ</i> occur there are actually a
large number of Whites which do not possess the
protective colours of the former nauseous family.
In the adoption of these new life conditions we
have not to deal therefore with survival or extermination,
but only with amelioration. It is not
every species of “White” that can become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
adapted to these conditions, because every species
does not give rise to the necessary colour variations;
those that do, become in this way modified,
because they are thus better protected than before.
And so it is throughout; wherever we find protected
insects enjoying immunity from foes we see
also mimickers, sometimes only single, sometimes
several, and generally from very diverse groups of
insects, according to the general resemblance
which existed before the commencement of the
process of adaptation, and to the variations made
possible by the physical nature of the species concerned.</p>

<p>In the first essay of the second part of this
work it was shown that in certain Lepidopterous
larvæ a process of adaptation is at the present
time still in progress, this depending upon the fact
that while the young caterpillar is very well protected
by the leaf-green colour of its body, this
colour becomes insufficient to conceal the insect
as soon as it exceeds the leaf in size. All such
caterpillars&mdash;and there is a whole series of species&mdash;as
they increase in size acquire the habit of
concealing themselves on the earth by day, and
of feeding only at night. New conditions of life
are thus imposed, and these are even compulsory,
<i>i.e.</i> they could not be abandoned without
risking the existence of the species. Now in
accordance with these new conditions, some individuals
in these species have lost the green colouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
of the young stages, and have acquired the
brown coloration of the dark surroundings of the
insects which conceal themselves by day. In one
species this change has now occurred in almost
all individuals, in others in only a larger or smaller
proportion of them. Now supposing that among
these species there occurred one, the physical
nature of which did not admit of the production of
brown shades of colour, would the species for this
reason succumb? Is it not conceivable that the
want of colour adaptation might be compensated
for by better concealment, <i>i.e.</i> by burrowing into
the earth, or by a greater fertility of the species,
or by the development of warning signals&mdash;supposing
the species to be unpalatable&mdash;or finally,
by the acquisition of a terrifying marking? In
other words, could not the caterpillar itself modify
the new condition of life&mdash;that of being concealed
by day&mdash;in accordance with variations made
possible by its physical nature?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact in one of these species the
green colour remains unchanged in spite of the
altered mode of life, and this species, wherever it
occurs, notwithstanding the persecution of entomologists,
is always common (<i>Deilephila Hippophaës</i>);
it conceals itself better and deeper however
than those other species which, like <i>Sphinx
Convolvuli</i>, are difficult to detect on account of
their brown colour. In another species the striking
yellowish green colouring is likewise retained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
the majority of individuals, but this species buries
itself by day in the loose soil (<i>Acherontia Atropos</i>).</p>

<p>To this it may be objected that there are also
compulsory changes in the conditions of life from
which the species cannot withdraw itself, but in
which adaptation must necessarily follow, or extermination
would take place.</p>

<p>Such compulsory conditions of life do most
assuredly occur, and there is indeed no doubt that
many living forms have perished through not
becoming transformed. I believe, however, that
such conditions occur much more rarely than one
is inclined to admit at first sight. As a rule the
alternative of immediate change or of extermination
is offered only by such changes in the conditions
of life as occur very rapidly. The sudden
appearance of a new and dominant enemy, such
as man, has already caused the extinction of
the Dodo (<i>Didus ineptus</i>), and of Steller’s Sea
Cow (<i>Rhytina Stelleri</i>), and of other vertebrate
animals, and constantly leads to the extermination
of many other species of different classes. When
in America hundreds of thousands of acres of
primeval forest are annually destroyed, the conditions
of life of a numerous fauna and flora must
be thereby suddenly changed, leaving no choice
but extermination.</p>

<p>Such abrupt changes in the conditions of life
occur, however, but seldom in nature unless
caused by man, and must therefore have very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
rarely happened in former epochs of the earth’s
history. Even climatic changes, which we might
at first regard as of this character, and which produce
a modification in one fixed direction, occur
always so gradually that the species has time
either to adapt itself to the conditions in this or
that direction, according to the variations possible
to its physical nature, or else to emigrate.</p>

<p>It thus appears to me erroneous to suppose
that variability must be “merely undetermined”
in order to complete its part in Darwin’s theory of
selection, and its “illimitedness” seems to me also
as little necessary for this purpose. Von Hartmann
imagines that it is only unlimited variability
that furnishes a guarantee that any type, to whatever
extent diverging from its point of departure,
will be reached by the Darwinian method of
gradual transmutation by means of selection and
the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>But who has ever asserted that <i>any</i> type can
be reached from any point? Or if anybody has
said such nonsense, who can prove that its admission
is necessary for the theory of selection?
Nowhere in systemy do we see any point of
support for such an assumption. But when Von
Hartmann imagines that the “unlimited” variability
which he postulates for Darwin “is in itself
unlimited, the limits of its divergence in a given
direction being found, not in itself, but only in
external obstacles,” he conceives variability to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
something independent of, and in some way added
to, the animal body, and not a mere expression
for the fluctuations in the type of the organism.
If, however, we conceive variability in this latter,
the true scientific sense, it is in no way “quantitatively
unlimited,” nor are its limits even determined
by <i>external</i> influences, but essentially by
<i>internal</i> influences, <i>i.e.</i> by the underlying physical
nature of the organism. Darwin has indeed
already shown this in a most beautiful manner in
his investigations upon the correlations of organs
and systems of organs of the body. To make
use of a metaphor, the forces acting within the
body are in equilibrium; if one organ becomes
changed this causes a disturbance in the forces,
and the equilibrium must be restored by changes
in other parts, and these again entail other modifications,
and so forth. Herein lies the reason
why the primary change cannot exceed a certain
amount if the restoration of the equilibrium is not
to be quite impossible. This is but a metaphor,
and I do not wish to assert that we are at present
in a position to formulate and demonstrate mathematically
for any particular case, how much an
organ can become changed in any one species
before an interruption of the internal harmony of
the body takes place. But such impossibility of
demonstration does not appear to me to furnish a
sufficient reason for regarding variability as the
expression of a directive power&mdash;as an “innate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>
tendency to variation conformable to <span class="locked">law.”<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> On
the contrary, it is to me easily conceivable that
we only learn to analyse the processes of nature
in detail very slowly, because of their necessary
complexity. It thus appears to me quite useless
when in this sense Wigand makes use of the
objection, that “the gooseberry has not undergone
any enlargement since 1852, although it is
inconceivable why it should not attain the size of
a pumpkin if variability was not internally limited.”
It may well be that this is for the present “inconceivable;”
nevertheless, this does not justify us
in setting up a hypothetical “force of variation”
which will not admit of the gooseberry surpassing
the pumpkin in size. We are bound to maintain
that it is the action and reaction of known forces
which sets a limit to the enlargement of this fruit.</p>

<p>In more simple instances the causes of such
limitations to growth can be well perceived.
Several decades have passed since Leuckart
proved in how exact a relation the proportion of
volume and surface stood to the degree of organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
of an animal. In animals of a spherical
form the surface is quite sufficient for respiration,
so long as they are of microscopic size. But
such an organism cannot become enlarged at
pleasure, because the ratio of the surface to the
volume would become quite different. The surface
increases as the square, whilst the volume increases
as the cube, so that very soon the surface
of the more rapidly increasing bodily mass can
no longer suffice for <span class="locked">respiration.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> This sort of
limitation is in no way equivalent to that purely
external kind which, for instance, manifests itself
in such a manner as to prevent the indefinite
lengthening of the tail feathers of the Bird of
Paradise. In this case feathers that were too
long would hinder flight, and such individuals
would accordingly be eliminated by natural selection.
The cause is in the former case purely
internal, depending upon the equilibrium of the
forces governing the organism.</p>

<p>Von Hartmann is entirely in the right when he
asserts that variability is neither qualitatively nor
quantitatively unlimited. In both senses it is
limited (in direction as well as in amount) by the
physico-chemical forces acting in some contrary
way in each specific organism&mdash;by the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
nature of each living form. He errs, however,
both in making absolute illimitability a necessary
postulate of the theory of selection, as also in
inferring the existence of a directive principle
from that limitation of variability which is certainly
present. “Tendencies to variation” do
however exist, not in the sense of a directive
power, but as expressions of the different physical
constitutions of species, which necessarily cause
unequal reactions to the same external actions, as
will be more clearly proved <span class="locked">below.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span></p>

<p>This is, of course, a modification of Darwin’s
original assumption of an unbounded variability
not limited in direction; but Darwin himself has
later coincided in the view that the quality of
the variations is essentially determined by the
nature of the <span class="locked">organism.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span></p>

<p>I now turn to the consideration of the second
factor of the theory of selection&mdash;heredity. This
also, according to Von Hartmann is not a mechanical
principle. Darwin himself has now
become convinced how great is the probability
against the hereditary retention of modifications
which, whether feebly or strongly pronounced,
appear <i>only in single individuals</i>, <i>i.e.</i> of those
so-called “fortuitous” variations which are not the
expression of a directive developmental principle.
“But as among the numberless possible directions
of an indefinite variability, useful modifications can
only occur in single cases, Darwin has by this
supplementary admission himself retracted an
inadmissible assumption of his theory of selection,”
and so forth. A “regular, designed
tendency to variation, acting from within and
contemporaneously affecting a large number of
individuals,” must therefore be assumed “in
order to insure the by itself improbable inheritance.”</p>

<p>But even from the unbounded variability laid
down by the author, it by no means follows that
useful variations can only occur in single individuals.
In the whole category of <i>quantitative</i>
variations the reverse is always the case. Is it
the lengthening of some part that is concerned;
so would a large number of individuals always
possess the useful variation, since we are not
dealing with an <i>absolute</i> enlargement, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
with the fact that the part concerned is longer
than in other <span class="locked">individuals.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span></p>

<p>But if <i>qualitative</i> variations come into consideration,
it may be asked whether Darwin’s
“supplementary admission” does not go too far.
Such calculations as those quoted by Darwin
from the article in the <i>North British Review</i> of
March 1867 are extremely deceptive, since we
have no means of measuring the amount of protection
afforded by a useful variation, and we can
therefore hardly compute with any certainty, in
how great a percentage of individuals a change
must contemporaneously occur in order to have a
chance of becoming transferred to the following
generation. If our blue rock-pigeon could exist
in a polar climate, and if we had the power of
introducing it gradually, but not suddenly, into
these regions in a wild state, who can doubt
that it would assume the white colour of all
polar animals? Nevertheless, among wild rock-pigeons
white varieties do not occur more frequently
than among swallows, crows, or magpies.
Or must the white colour of polar animals, the
yellow colour of desert species, and the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
colour of leaf-frequenting forms, be always referred
to a “regular, designed, fixed tendency to
variation acting from within,” and causing a
“large number of individuals” to vary in a similar
manner?</p>

<p>There is, however, a grain of truth in the foregoing;
variations which occur singly have but
little chance of becoming predominant characters,
and this is obviously what Darwin concedes. But
this is by no means equivalent to the assumption
that only those variations which from the first
occur in numerous individuals have a chance of
being perpetuated. Let us keep to the facts.
We have not the slightest reason either for regarding
the white colour of polar animals as the
direct action of cold, or for considering that the
green colour of foliage-living caterpillars depends
upon direct action arising from the habit of
resting upon the <span class="locked">leaves;<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span> both these characters
are explicable only by natural selection, and there
is nothing to favour the assumption (which Von
Hartmann postulates as necessary for success)
that many individuals varied into white at the
same time. We know no single extra-polar
species of a dark colour which frequently, <i>i.e.</i> in
many individuals of every generation, varies into
white, but we know many species which from time
to time produce single white individuals. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
when, on the other hand, we find that all polar
animals to which the white coloration is advantageous,
and indeed none but species of which
the nearest allies vary only individually into white,
possess this colour, must we not conclude from
this alone that <i>single</i> variations can, under
favourable conditions, become predominant characters?</p>

<p>It appears to me that in this question one
weighty factor has been too little regarded, even
by the supporters of the selection theory, viz., the
slowness of most, and especially of climatic
changes, which I have already insisted upon. If
the transformation of a temperate into an arctic
climate occurred so rapidly that the species exposed
to it had the alternative either of becoming
white in ten or twenty generations or of being
unable to exist, then the hasty intervention of a
directive power could alone save them from extermination
by causing hundreds of thousands of
individuals to become similarly coloured with all
speed. But it is quite different if the change of
climate takes place only in the course of several
thousand generations; and this, according to the
geological evidence, must have been the true state
of the case.</p>

<p>Let us take a definite example&mdash;the well-known
one of the hare. With us this animal remains
brown in the winter and but seldom produces
white varieties, whilst its ally the Alpine hare is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
white during seven months of the year, the Norwegian
hare during nine months, and the Greenland
hare throughout the whole year. If our
climate became transformed into an arctic one,
after a given time there would arrive a period
when the older coloration no longer possessed
any advantage over the occasional and singly-appearing
white variations; the winter days during
which the ground was covered with snow would
have become so numerous, that the protection
afforded to the white animals would be equal to
the protection enjoyed by the brown individuals
on the equally numerous days free from snow.
From this time forth the hares that were white in
winter would not be subjected to a greater decimation
by foxes, &amp;c., than the brown individuals.
This period must however be represented as consisting
of one or more centuries, and it would be
strange if from the individual white hares, which
now had an equal chance of existing, some white
families did not become established. But the
state of affairs would gradually become reversed&mdash;the
brown hares would experience greater decimation,
and wherever there were white families
these would possess an advantage in the struggle
for existence. It does not follow that the dark
individuals would be forthwith extirpated; on the
contrary, the advantage in favour of the white
would be but small throughout a long period of
time, and these individuals would only gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span>
increase to a higher percentage of the total
population; nevertheless their numbers would
constantly but very slowly augment. In the
course of time this increase would become more
rapid for two reasons&mdash;first, because even a very
small advantage in favour of the increasing
number of individuals would always leave a
greater number of these victorious; and secondly,
because on the whole as the climate became more
arctic, the advantage of being white would continually
become more decisive in determining
which should live and which should succumb.</p>

<p>Thus I see no reason why individual variations
which do not appear only once, but which frequently
recur in the course of generations, should
not acquire predominance under favourable conditions.
All facts are in accord with this. Even
the common hare shows us that it would be quite
capable of becoming coloured in a similar manner.
In the museum of Stuttgart there are three specimens
of <i>Lepus timidus</i>, killed in Wurtemburg,
which are completely white, and several others
which are silver-grey or spotted with white. In
eastern Russia the common hare possesses a
light grey, almost white, winter coat, and <span class="locked">Seidlitz<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span>
makes known the interesting observation
that such light specimens occur <i>singly</i> in Livonia,
where “the common hare has become naturalized
since the commencement of the century.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span></p>

<p>As I have already insisted upon above, from
the point of view of the conditions of life there is
no reason for assuming rapid transformations;
the change of conditions is almost always extremely
slow; and indeed in numerous instances
no objective change occurs, but simply a subjective
one, if we may thus designate those cases
in which the alteration in the conditions of life
depends upon a change in the animal form which
is undergoing transformation, and not in that of
the environment. This is the case in the above-mentioned
instances of mimicry, where the whole
change in the conditions of life arises from one
species becoming similar to another. The process
of natural selection has here as long a period
of time as it requires to perfect its results. It is
quite similar in all cases of special protective
adaptations of form and colour. In all these it is
always <i>improvement</i> that is concerned, and not the
question “to be or not to be” with which we
have to deal.</p>

<p>It is just cases of this last kind, however,
which are best fitted for exposing the improbability
and insufficiency of the assumption of a
variational tendency as a distinct directive power.
We have only to fix our attention upon some particular
case of sympathetic colouring, or, still
better, of mimicry. A “tendency to variation”
implies that a large number of individuals produce
varieties resembling the model to be imitated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span>
this&mdash;at least according to Von Hartmann&mdash;must
take place in each of the successive generations,
so that by this means, combined with heredity,
the useful variation becomes increased. But how
comes it that this “tendency to variation” coincides
with the existence of the model both in time and
place? Can this be due to accident if the two
have not a common cause? The upholders of a
directive power will certainly not admit this; so
that there remains only Leibnitz’s assumption of a
pre-established harmony contained in the first organic
germ, which, after innumerable transformations
of the organic form and after millions of years,
gave rise in the midst of the Amazonian region to an
inedible Heliconide with certain yellow, black, and
white markings on the wings, and at precisely the
same time developed the tendency in a Pieride at
the same spot on the globe to imitate this Heliconide
as a model!</p>

<p>In addition to this assumption, which is
certainly but little worthy of consideration, there
is perhaps one other remaining, viz., that all or
many Pierides and other species of butterflies
possessed the same tendency to a Heliconoid
variation and were always everywhere striving to
develop this type, but succeeded only where they
accidentally coincided in time and place with the
model, the “tendency” being thus furthered by
natural selection. But the facts negative this
assumption, since such imitative variations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span>
never been observed to a perceptible extent in
other <span class="locked">species.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span></p>

<p>All variations which are demonstrably useful
can be similarly dealt with if their origin is explained
by variational tendencies.</p>

<p>We perceive that the objection which Von
Hartmann brings against heredity is only valid on
the ground that this process affords no security
for the preservation of variations which occur
singly. That heredity itself is a mechanical process
is not directly disputed; it is simply assumed
that new characters can be transferred by inheritance
only when they are produced by the
metaphysical “developmental principle,” and not
when they arise “accidentally.” This critic does
not therefore direct his attack against heredity,
but rather against the mechanical origin of variability.</p>

<p>Von Hartmann might have said here that a
reference of the phenomenon of heredity to purely
mechanical causes, <i>i.e.</i> a mechanical theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
heredity, is up to the present time wanting. That
he has not done so proves on the one hand that
he despised the dialectical art, but, on the other
hand, that he himself has not overlooked the subserviency
of the total phenomenon to law, and
that he grants the possibility of finding a mechanical
explanation therefor. If, in fact, the
power of inheritance does not depend upon
mechanical principles, I know not what organic
processes we are entitled to regard as mechanical,
since they are all dependent in essence upon
heredity, with which process they are at one, and
from which they cannot be thought of as isolated.
Haeckel correctly designates reproduction as surplus
individual growth, and accordingly refers the
phenomena of heredity to those of growth. Conversely,
growth may also be designated reproduction,
since it depends upon a continuous process
of multiplication of the cells composing the
organism, from the germ-cell to the innumerable
congeries of variously differentiated cells of the
highly developed animal body. Who can fail to
see that these two processes, the reproduction of
the germ-cell and its offspring in the economy of
the individual, and the reproduction of individuals
and species in the economy of the organic world,
show an exact and by no means simply superficial
analogy?<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> But whoso grants this must
also conceive both processes to depend upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">667</a></span>
same cause&mdash;he cannot assume for the one a
causal power and for the other a directive
principle. If nutrition and cell-multiplication are
purely mechanical processes, so also is heredity.
Although it has not yet been possible to demonstrate
the mechanism of this phenomenon, it can
nevertheless be seen broadly that by means of a
minimum of living organic matter (<i>e.g.</i> the protoplasm
of the sperm and germ-cell) certain motions
are transferred, and these can be regarded as
directions of development, as I have already
briefly laid down in a former <span class="locked">work.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span> The power
of organisms to transmit their properties to their
offspring appears to me to be only conceivable in
such a manner “that the germ of the organism
by its chemico-physical composition together with
its molecular structure, has communicated to it a
fixed direction of development&mdash;the same direction
of development as that originally possessed
by the parental organism....” (<i>loc. cit.</i> p.
24). This is confessedly nothing more than a
hint, and we do not learn therefrom the means by
which developmental direction can be possibly
transferred to another organism.</p>

<p>Recently Haeckel, that indefatigable pioneer to
whom we are indebted for such a rich store of
new ideas, has attempted to bridge over this gap
in his essay on “The Perigenesis of the Plastidule,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
Berlin, 1876. The basic idea, that heredity
depends upon the transference of motion, and
variability upon a change of this motion, completely
corresponds with the conviction gained in
the province of physical science, that “all laws
must finally be merged in laws of motion”
(Helmholtz<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>). I hold this view to be the more
completely justifiable&mdash;although certainly not in
the remotest degree as proved&mdash;because I
formerly designated the acquired individual variations
as the “diversion of the inherited direction
of development.” Haeckel’s hypothesis in so far
accomplishes more than Darwin’s pangenesis, in
which a transference of matter, and not of a
species of motion peculiar to this matter, is
assumed. But although the germ of a mechanical
theory of heredity may be contained in Haeckel’s
hypothesis, this nevertheless appears to me to be
somewhat remote from completely solving the
problem. It brings well into prominence one
portion of the process of inheritance; under the
image of a molecular motion of the plastidule,
which motion is modifiable by external influences,
we can well understand the fact of a change
gradually taking place in the course of generations.
On the other hand, the assumption of
consciousness in the plastidule,&mdash;however admissible
philosophically&mdash;although only as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
formula, scarcely furnishes any deeper knowledge.
In the light of a theory, detailed instances which
were formerly obscure should become comprehensible.
I fail to see, however, how the
various forms of atavism, <i>e.g.</i> the reversions which
so commonly occur by crossing different races,
become more comprehensible by assuming consciousness
in the plastidule. If in both parents
the plastidule long ago acquired different molecular
motions, why, in its rencounters in the germ,
does it recollect past times and reassume the
older and long abandoned motion? That it does
acquire the latter is indeed a fact if we once refer
the directional development of the individual to
molecular motion of the plastidule; the wherefore
does not appear to me, however, to become
clearer by assuming consciousness in the plastidule.
A mechanical theory of heredity must
rather be able to show that the plastidule movements
of the male and female germ-cells, in their
rencounter in the case of the crossing of widely
divergent forms, become mutually modified in
such a manner that the motion of the common
ancestral form must occur as the resultant. To
such demonstration there is however as yet a long
step. Haeckel himself moreover points out that
his hypothesis is by no means a “mechanical
theory of heredity,” but only an introduction to
this theory, which he hopes “will be capable of
being elevated to the rank of a genetic molecular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span>
theory” (<i>loc. cit.</i> p. 17). But although we must
also confess with the critic of the “Philosophy of
the Unconscious,” that “the facts of heredity have
hitherto defied every scientific <span class="locked">explanation,”<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span>
this furnishes us with no excuse for flying to a
metaphysical explanation, “which is here certainly
least able to satisfy the inability to understand
the connection arising from natural laws.”</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that Von Hartmann,
on the ground of the “Unconscious” on which he
takes his stand, speaks of the law of correlation
as an unconscious acknowledgment of a “non-mechanical
universal principle on the side of
Darwinism.” By “correlation” he understands
something quite different to the idea which we
attach to this expression. He supposes that
“Darwinism sees itself compelled to acknowledge
through empirical facts the uniform correlation of
characters pertaining to the specific type; but it
thereby contradicts its mechanical principles of
explanation, all of which amount to the same
thing as conceiving the type as a mosaic,
chequered, superficial, and accidental aggregate
of characters, which have been singly acquired,
contemporaneously or successively, by selection
or habit.” I do not believe, however, that any
such conception has ever been admitted either by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">671</a></span>
Darwin or any one else. The admission that not
all, but only every deep-seated <i>physiological</i> detailed
modification, is or may be bound up with a
system of correlated changes, indeed implies that
we on our side also acknowledge an internal
harmony of parts&mdash;an equilibrium, as I have above
expressed it.</p>

<p>But does this include the admission of a teleological
principle, or exclude a mechanical explanation?
Do we thereby acknowledge a “specific
type” in the sense of an inseparably connected
complex of characters, none of which can be taken
away without all the others becoming modified?
Does such a view agree generally with the empirical
facts?</p>

<p>Neither of these views appears to me to represent
the case.</p>

<p>I will first answer the second question. On all
possible sides the earlier view of the absolute
nature of species is contradicted; there is no
boundary between species and varieties. But
when Von Hartmann assumes that by the transformation
of one species “into another” the
“whole uniformly connected complex must become
changed,” he falls back into the old
doctrine of the absolute nature of species, which
is sharply contradicted by multitudes of facts.
We not unfrequently observe varieties which
differ from the parent-form by only a single
character, whilst others show numerous differences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">672</a></span>
and again others may be seen in which the
differences predominate. This last deviation
would then be designated by many systematists
as a new species, but not so by others.</p>

<p>The “specific type” is thus indeed a kind of
mosaic-work, but it is a structure to which all the
single characters&mdash;the stones of the mosaic&mdash;belong
and build up one harmonious whole, and
not a meaningless confusion. Some of the stones
or groups of stones can be taken away and replaced
by others differently coloured without the
structure being thereby necessarily distorted, <i>i.e.</i>
destroyed as a structure; but the larger the stones
which are exchanged the more necessary will
corrections in the other parts of the structure
become, in order that the harmony of the whole
may be preserved.</p>

<p>Still more weighty than those insensible transitions
which in various groups of animals so
frequently connect species with species, appear
to me, however, the facts made known in the
second essay of the second part of this volume,
which prove that the two forms in which one
species appears can change entirely independently
of one another. The caterpillar changes and
becomes a new variety or even species (according
to the form-value of the change), whilst the
butterfly remains unaltered. How could this
occur if some other law than that of physiological
equilibrium linked together the parts or characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">673</a></span>
and permitted them to become severed?
Must not the two stages become changed with
and through one another, like the parts of one
body, since they first together constitute the
specific type? Is not the fact of this not happening
a proof that the whole “uniformly connected
complex” of the specific type is not bound and
held together by a metaphysical principle, but
simply by natural laws?</p>

<p>Now when Von Hartmann comprises the relations
of different species to one another under
the idea of correlation, such for instance as the
relation of dependence in which orchidaceous
flowers stand with respect to the insects which
visit them, he completely abandons the scientific
conception which should be associated with this
expression, and compares together two heterogeneous
things which have nothing in common
excepting that they are both considered by him as
a result of the “Unconscious.” The consequence
which is then deduced from this correlation of his
own construction, viz., that an organic law of
correlation is only another expression for a “law
of organic development” in the sense of a metaphysical
power, obviously cannot be admitted.</p>

<p>By correlation we understand nothing more
than the dependence of one part of the organism
upon the others and the mutual inter-relations of
these parts, which depend entirely upon a “physiological
relation of dependence,” as Von Hartmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span>
himself has correctly designated it. Herein is
evidently comprised the total morphology of the
organism&mdash;the structure as a whole, the length,
thickness and weight of the single parts, as well
as the histological structure of the tissues, since
upon all these depends the performance of the
single parts. But when, under correlation, Von
Hartmann comprises “also a morphological,
systematic, inter-action of all the elements of the
organism with reference both to the typical
ground-plan of the organization as well as to the
microscopic anatomical structure of the tissues,”
he drags into the idea something foreign to it, not
on the ground of facts, but actually in opposition
to them, and supported only by a supposed
“innate developmental principle” which “is not
of a mechanical nature.”</p>

<p>The living organism has already been often
compared with a crystal, and the comparison is,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, justifiable. As in the growing
crystal the single molecules cannot become
joined together at pleasure, but only in a fixed
manner, so are the parts of an organism governed
in their respective distribution. In the crystal
where nothing but homogeneous parts become
grouped together their resulting combination is
likewise homogeneous, and it is obvious that they
offer but very little possibility of modification, so
that the governing laws thus appear restricted
and immutable. In the organism, whether regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
microscopically or macroscopically, various
parts become combined, and these therefore offer
numerous possibilities of modification, so that the
governing laws are more complex, and appear less
restricted and unchangeable. In neither instance
do we know the final causes which always lead to
a given state of equilibrium; in the case of a
crystal it has not occurred to anybody to ascribe
the harmonious disposition of the parts to a teleological
power; why then should we assume such
a force in the organism, and thus discontinue the
attempt, which has already been commenced, to
refer to its natural causes that harmony of
parts which is here certainly present and equally
conformable to law?</p>

<p>On these grounds the assertion that the theory
of selection is not an attempt at a “mechanical”
explanation of organic development appears to
me to be incorrect. Variability and heredity, as
well as correlation, admit of being conceived as
purely mechanical, and must be thus regarded so
long as no more cogent reasons can be adduced
for believing that some force other than physico-chemical
lies concealed therein.</p>

<p>But we certainly cannot remain at the purely
empirical conception as laid down by Darwin in
his admirable work on the “Origin of Species.”
If the theory of selection is to furnish a method
of mechanical explanation, it is essential that its
factors should be formulated in a precise mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
sense. But as soon as we attempt to do this
it is seen that, in the first enthusiasm over the
newly discovered principle of selection, the one
factor of transformation contained in this principle
itself has been unduly pushed into the background,
to make way for the other more apparent and
better known factors.</p>

<p>I have for many years insisted that the first, and
perhaps most important, or in any case the most
indispensable, factor in every transformation, is <i>the
physical nature of the organism itself</i>.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>It would be an error to believe that it is entirely
the external conditions which determine what
changes shall appear in a given species; the
nature of these changes depends essentially upon
the physical constitution of the species itself, and
a modification actually arising can obviously be
only regarded as the resultant of this constitution
and of the external influences acting thereon.</p>

<p>But if an essential or perhaps even a preponderating
share in determining new characters is to be
undoubtedly ascribed to the organism itself, for
a mechanical representation of organic developmental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
processes everything depends upon our
being able to conceive this most important factor
in a definite theoretical manner, and to comprise
under one common point of view its apparently
contradictory manifestations of constancy and
variability.</p>

<p>Now every change of considerable extent is
certainly considered by Darwin to be the direct or
indirect consequence of external actions; but indirect
action always presupposes a certain small
variability (individual variability), without which
larger modifications cannot be brought about.
Empirically this small amount of variability is
doubtless present, but the question arises, upon
what does it depend? Can it be conceived as
arising mechanically, or is it perhaps just at this
point that the metaphysical principle steps in and
offers those minute variations which make possible
that course of development which, according to
this view, is immutably pre-determined? It is
certainly the absence of a theoretical definition of
variability which always leaves open a door for
smuggling in a teleological power. A mechanical
explanation of variability must form the basis of
this side of the theory of selection.</p>

<p>This explanation is not difficult to find. All
dissimilarities of organisms must depend upon the
individuals having been affected by dissimilar external
influences during the course of the development
of organic nature. If we ascribe to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
organism the power of giving rise by multiplication
only to exact copies of itself, or, more
correctly, the power of transmitting unaltered to
its successors the motion of its own course of
development, each “individual variation” must
depend upon the power of the organism to react
upon external influences, <i>i.e.</i> to respond by
changes of form and of function, and consequently
to modify its original (inherited) developmental
direction.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been insisted upon, that the
“individuals of the same species” or the offspring
of one mother cannot be absolutely equal, because,
from the commencement of their existence, they
have been subjected to dissimilar actions of the
environment. But this implies that by perfectly
equal influences they would become equal, <i>i.e.</i> it
supposes that variability is not inseparably bound
up with the essence of the organism, but is only
the consequence of developmental tendencies
which are in themselves equal being unequally
influenced. As a matter of fact the first germs of
an individual certainly cannot be supposed to be
perfectly equal, because the individual differences
of the ancestors must be contained therein in
different degrees according to their constitution,
and we should have to go back to the primordial
organism of the earth in order to find a perfectly
homogeneous root, a <i>tabula rasa</i> from which the
descendants would commence their development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
Whether such a homogeneous root ever existed is
however doubtful; it is much more probable that
<i>numerous</i> organisms first arose <span class="locked">spontaneously,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span>
and these cannot be presumed to have been absolutely
equal, since the conditions under which
they came into life cannot have been perfectly
identical. Let us, however, for the sake of simplicity
assume a single primordial organism; the
first generation which took its rise from this by
reproduction could only have possessed such
individual differences as were produced by the
action of dissimilar external influences. But the
third generation, together with self-acquired,
would also have shown <i>inherited</i>, dissimilarities,
and in each succeeding generation the number of
tendencies to individual difference imparted to the
germ by heredity must have increased to a certain
degree, so that it may be said that all germs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">680</a></span>
from their first origination, bear in themselves a
tendency to show individual peculiarities, and
would develop these even if they should not be
again affected by dissimilar influences. This is
obviously the case, since the youngest egg-cells in
the ovary of an animal are, as can be demonstrated,
always exposed to unequal external conditions
with respect to nutrition and <span class="locked">pressure.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span>
Hence, if it were possible that two germs were
exactly equal with respect to the direction of
development imparted to them by heredity, they
would nevertheless furnish two incongruent individuals;
and if, conversely, it were possible that
two individuals could be exposed to absolutely
the same external influences from the formation
of the embryo, these also could not be identical,
because the individual differences of the ancestors
would entail small differences, even in asexual
reproduction, in the direction of development
transmitted to the egg. The differences between
individuals of similar origin thus finally depend
entirely upon the dissimilarity of external influences&mdash;on
the one side upon those which divert
the development of the progenitors, and on the
other side upon those which divert the individual
itself from its course, <i>i.e.</i> from the developmental
direction transmitted hereditarily. Although I
thus essentially agree with Darwin and Haeckel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span>
in so far as these authors refer the “universal
individual dissimilarity” to dissimilar external
actions, I differ from Darwin in this, that I do not
see an essential distinction between the direct
and indirect production of individual differences,
if by the latter is meant only the unequal influencing
of the germ in the parental organism.
Haeckel is certainly correct in referring the
“primitive differences of the germs produced by
the parents” to the inequalities of nutrition to
which the single germs must inevitably have been
exposed in the parent organism; but another
dissimilarity of the germs must evidently be added&mdash;a
dissimilarity which has nothing to do with
unequal nutrition, but which depends upon unequal
inheritance of the individual differences of
the ancestors, a source of dissimilarity which
must arise to a greater extent in sexual than in
asexual reproduction. Just as in sexual propagation
there occurs a blending of the characters (or
more precisely, developmental directions) of two
<i>contemporaneous individuals</i> in <i>one</i> germ, so in
every mode of reproduction there meet together
in the same germ the characters of a whole <i>succession
of individuals</i> (the ancestral series), of
which the most remote certainly make themselves
but seldom felt in a marked degree.</p>

<p>The fact of individual variability can in this way
be well understood; the living organism contains
in itself no principle of variability&mdash;it is the <i>statical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
element</i> in the developmental processes of the organic
world, and would always reproduce exact
copies of itself if the inequality of the external
influences did not affect the developmental course
of each new individual; these influences are therefore
the <i>dynamical elements</i> of the process.</p>

<p>From this conception of variability two important
empirically established facts can be
theoretically deduced, viz. the limitability of
variation with respect to quality, which has already
been previously mentioned, and the origination of
transformations by the direct action of external
conditions of life.</p>

<p>If the differences in individuals of the same origin
depend upon the action of unequal influences,
variation itself is nothing else than the reaction of
the organism to a definite external inciting cause,
the quality of the variation being determined by
the quality of the inciting cause and by that of
the organism. In the cases of individual variation
hitherto considered, the quality of the organism is
equal but that of the inciting cause is unequal,
and in this way there arise minute differences in
organisms of an equal physical constitution&mdash;variations
of a different quality.</p>

<p>The same result, viz., different qualities of
variation, may also arise in a reverse manner by
organisms of a different physical nature being
affected by equal external influences. The response
of the organism to the cause inciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
change would be different according to its nature,
or, in other words, organisms of different natures
react differently when affected by equal modifying
influences. The physical nature of the organism
plays the chief part with respect to the quality of
the variations; each specific organism can thus
give rise to extremely numerous, but not to all
conceivable, variations; that is, only to such variations
as are made possible by its physical
composition. From this it follows further that
the possibilities of variation in two species are
more widely different, the wider they diverge in
physical constitution (including bodily morphology)&mdash;that
a cycle of variation is peculiar to
every species. In this manner we are led to the
knowledge that there must certainly exist a “fixed
direction of variation,” but not in the sense of
Askenasy and Von Hartmann, as the result of an
unknown internal principle of development, but as
the necessary, <i>i.e.</i> mechanical, consequence of the
unequal physical nature of the species, which
must respond even to the same inciting cause by
unequal variations.</p>

<p>The facts, as far as we know them, agree very
well with this conclusion. Allied species vary in
a similar manner, whilst species which are more
distantly related vary in a different manner, even
when acted upon by the same external influences.
Thus, in the first part of these “Studies” I have
remarked that many butterflies under the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">684</a></span>
of a warm climate acquire an almost black coloration
(<i>Polyommatus Phlæas</i>), whilst on the other
hand others become lighter (<i>Papilio Podalirius</i>).</p>

<p>We can thus understand why always certain
courses of development are followed, a fact which
cannot be completely explained by the nature of
the conditions of life which induce the variations.
But as soon as we clearly perceive that the quality
of the changes essentially depends upon the
physical nature of the organism itself, we arrive
at the conclusion that species of widely diverging
constitutions must give rise to different variations,
whilst those of allied constitutions would produce
similar variations. But definite courses of development
are thus traced out, and we perceive
that from any point of the organic developmental
series, it is impossible that any other point can be
attained at pleasure. Variation in a definite
direction thus by no means necessitates the
acknowledgment of a metaphysical developmental
principle, but can be well conceived as
the mechanical result of the physical constitution
of the organism.</p>

<p>The manner in which the dissimilar physical
constitution of organisms must arise can also be
easily shown, although the first commencement
of the whole developmental series, <i>i.e.</i> the oldest
living forms must be assumed to have been almost
homogeneous in their physical constitution.
The quality of the variation is, as said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
not merely the product of the physical constitution,
but the resultant of this and of the quality
of the changing external conditions. Thus from
the first “species” there proceeded, through the
dissimilar influence of external conditions of life,
several new “species,” and as this took place the
former physical nature of the organism at the
same time became changed, necessitating also a
new mode of reacting upon external influences, <i>i.e.</i>
another direction of variation. The difference
from the primary “species” must certainly be conceived
as having been very minute, but it must
have increased with each new transformation, and
must have proceeded exactly parallel with the
degree of physical change connected with each
transformation. Thus, hand in hand with the
modifications, the power of modification, or mode
of reaction of the organism to changing influences,
must have continually become re-modified, and
we finally obtain an endless number of differently
constituted living forms, of which the variational
tendencies are different in exact proportion to
their physical divergence, so that nearly allied
forms respond similarly, and widely divergent
forms very differently, to the same inciting
causes.</p>

<p>Individual variation arises, as I have attempted
to show, by each individual having been
continually affected by different, and indeed by
constantly changing, influences. Let us, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
imagine on the contrary, that a large group
of individuals is affected by the same influences&mdash;in
fact by such influences as the remaining individuals
of the species are not exposed to: this
group of individuals would then vary in a nearly
similar manner, since both factors of variation, viz.
the external influence and the physical constitution,
are equal or nearly so. Such local
variations would first become prominent when
the same external influence had acted upon a
series of generations, and the minima of variation
produced in the individual by the once-exerted
action of the cause inciting change had become
augmented by heredity. Transformations of
some importance (up to the form-value of species)
can thus arise simply by the direct action
of the environment, in the same way as that in
which individual differences are produced&mdash;only
the latter fluctuate from generation to generation,
since the inciting influences continually change;
whilst, in the former, the constant external cause
inciting modification always reproduces the same
variation, so that an accumulation of the latter
can take place. Climatic varieties can be thus
explained.</p>

<p>A more efficacious augmentation of the variations
arising in the single individual is certainly
brought about by the <i>indirect</i> action of the environment
upon the organism. It is not here my
intention to explain once more the processes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
natural selection; I mention this only in order to
point out that in these cases transformation
depends upon a <i>double action</i> of the environment,
since the latter first induces small deviations in
the organism by direct action, and then accumulates
by selection the variations thus produced.</p>

<p>By regarding variability in this manner&mdash;by
considering each variation as the reaction of the
organism to an external action, as a diversion of
the inherited developmental direction, it follows
that without a change in the environment no advance
in the development of organic forms can
take place. If we imagine that from any period
in the earth’s history the conditions of life remain
completely unchanged, the species present on the
earth at this period would not, according to our
view, undergo any further modification. Herein
is clearly expressed the difference of this view
from that other one according to which the inciting
principle of modification is not in the environment,
but lies in the organism itself in the form
of a phyletic vital force.</p>

<p>I cannot here refrain from once more returning
to the old (ontogenetic) vital force of the natural
philosophers, since the parallel between this and
its younger sister, the “phyletic vital force”
which appears in so many disguises, is indeed
striking. Were the inciting principle of the
development of the individual actually an independent
vital force acting within the organism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
the birth and growth of the individual would
be able to take place without the continuous encroachment
of the environment, such as occurs
in nutrition and respiration. Now this is known
to be impossible, so that those who support the
existence of such a force, if any still exist, would
be driven to the obscure idea of a co-operation
between the designing power and the influences
of the environment, just in the same manner as
such a co-operation is at present postulated by
the defenders of the phyletic vital force. I shall
further on take the opportunity of pointing out
that this last idea is quite untenable; with respect
to the (ontogenetic) vital force any clearer proof
cannot well be adduced, but it will be admitted
that the confused notion of the co-operation and
inter-action of teleological and causal powers is,
from our point of view, opposed to those very
simple and clear ideas which are in harmony with
the views on phyletic development. As in racial
development each change of the organic type is
entirely dependent upon the action of the environment
upon the organism, so in the development
of the individual, the totality of the phenomena of
the personal life must depend upon similar actions.
Physiology, as is known, herein entirely supports
our view, since this shows that without the continual
alternating action of the environment and
of the organism there can be no life, and that
vital phenomena are nothing but the reactions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span>
the organism to the influences of the environment.</p>

<p>It will be immediately perceived how exactly
the processes of phyletic and of ontogenetic development
coincide, not merely in their external
phenomena but in their nature, if we trace the
consequences of the existing knowledge of the
structure of the animal body. Although we may
not entirely agree with Haeckel’s doctrine of individuality
in its details, its correctness must on
the whole be conceded, since it cannot be disputed
that the notion of individuality is a relative
one, and that several categories of morphological
individuals exist, which appear not only <i>singly</i> as
<i>physiological individuals</i>, <i>i.e.</i> as independent living
beings of lowest grade, but which can also
<i>combine</i> to form beings of a higher order.</p>

<p>But if we admit this, we should see with Haeckel
nothing but reproduction in the origination of a
high organism from a single cell, the egg; this
reproduction being at the same time combined
with various differentiations of the offspring, <i>i.e.</i>
with adaptations of the latter to various conditions
of life. Not even in the fact that the
tissues and organs of a single physiological individual
stand in great dependence upon one
another through physical <span class="locked">causes,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> is there any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
striking difference between this view and the
phyletic composition of the animal (and vegetable)
kingdom out of physiological individuals (Haeckel’s
“<i>Bionten</i>”), since contemporaneous animals (individuals
and species) are known to influence one
another in the most active manner.</p>

<p>Now if we further consider that the same units
(cells) which, by their reproduction and division
of labour, at present compose the body of the
highest organism, must at one time have constituted
as independent beings the beginning of the
whole of organic creation, and that consequently
the same processes (division of cells) which now
lead to the formation of a mammal, at that time
led only to a long series of different independent
beings, it will be admitted that both developmental
series must depend upon the same inciting
powers, and that with reference to the causes of
the phenomena it is not possible that any great
gap can exist between ontogeny and phylogeny,
<i>i.e.</i> between the life-phenomena of the individual
and those of the type. According to our view
both depend upon that co-operation of the same
material physical forces which admits of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
briefly summarized as the reaction of organized
living matter to influences of the environment.</p>

<p>Our opponents either cannot boast of such
harmony in their conception of nature, or else
they must, together with the phyletic vital force,
re-admit into their theory the old ontogenetic
vital force. I know not indeed why they should
not do so. Whoever inclines to the view that
organic nature is governed not merely by causal,
but at the same time by teleological, forces, may
admit that the latter are as effective as inciting
causes of individual, as they are of phyletic, development.
According to my idea they are even
bound to admit this, since it cannot be perceived
why the adaptations of the ontogeny should not
depend upon the same metaphysical principle
assumed for each individual, as the adaptations
of the phylogeny; the latter are indeed only
brought about by the former. I believe therefore
that the vital force (ontogenetic) of the ancients
stands or falls with the modern (phyletic) vital
force. We must admit both or neither, since
they both rest on the same basis, and are supported
or opposed by the same arguments.
Whoever feels justified in setting up a metaphysical
principle where complete proof that
<i>known forces</i> are sufficient for the explanation of
the phenomena has not yet been adduced, must
do the same with respect to individual, as he does
to phyletic, development, since this proof is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
both cases very far from being complete, and still
contains large and numerous <span class="locked">gaps.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span></p>

<p>The theoretical conception of variation as the
reaction of the organism to external influences
has also not yet been experimentally shown to be
correct. Our experiments are still too coarse
as compared with the fine distinctions which
separate one individual from another; and the
difficulty of obtaining clear results is greatly increased
by the circumstance that a portion of
the individual deviations always depends upon
heredity, so that it is frequently not only difficult,
but absolutely impossible, to separate those which
are inherited from those which are acquired.
Still further are we removed from being able to
refer variation to its final mechanical causes, <i>i.e.</i>
from a mechanical theory of reproduction, which
would bring within the range of mathematical
calculation both the phenomena of stability
(heredity) and of change (variability).</p>

<p>But although sufficient proofs of the correctness
of the views here advocated cannot at
present be adduced, these views are not contradicted
by any known facts&mdash;they are, on the
contrary, supported by many facts which they in
turn make comprehensible (local forms, different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
cycles of variation in heterogeneous species).
These views are finally completely justified by
their furnishing the only possible theoretical
formulation of variability on which a mechanical
conception of organic development can be based.
That such a conception is not only admissible,
but is unavoidable, at least to the naturalist, I
have already attempted to prove.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h4 id="P3-4-2">II.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Mechanism and Teleology.</span></span></h4>

<p>In the third volume of his smaller works Karl
Ernst von Baer submits the theory of selection
to a most searching examination. Without
actually calling in question its scientific admissibility,
he believes that this theory is dependent
upon its satisfying one condition, viz. that it
should connect the teleological with the mechanical
principle.</p>

<p>“The Darwinian hypothesis, as stated by its
supporters, always ends in denying to the processes
of nature any relation to a future, <i>i.e.</i> any
relation of aim or design. Since such relations
appear to me <i>quite evident</i>,” &amp;c. And further:&mdash;“If
the scientific correctness of the Darwinian
hypothesis is to be admitted, it must accommodate
itself to this universal striving after a purpose.
If it cannot do this we should have to deny its
value.”</p>

<p>These words appear almost equivalent to
passing a sentence of doom upon the theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
selection and the mechanical conception of nature,
for how can one and the same process be effected
simultaneously by necessity and by designing
powers? The one excludes the other, and we
must&mdash;so it appears&mdash;take our stand either on
one side or the other.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we cannot set aside Von Baer’s
proposition without further examination simply
because it is apparently incapable of being fulfilled,
since it contains a truth which should not
be overlooked, even by those who uphold the
mechanical theory of nature. It is the same
truth which is also made use of by the philosophical
opponents of this theory, viz. that the
universe as a whole cannot be conceived as having
arisen from blind necessity&mdash;that the endless
harmony revealed in every nook and corner by
all the phenomena of organic and of inorganic
nature cannot possibly be regarded as the work
of chance, but rather as the result of a “vast
designed process of development.” It is also
quite correct when, in reply to the supposed objection
that the mechanical theory of nature is
not concerned with chances but with necessities,
Von Baer answers that the operations of a series
of necessities which “are not connected together”
can only be termed accidents in their opposing
relations. He illustrates this by instancing a
target. If I hit the latter by a well-aimed shot,
nobody would explain this as the result of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span>
accident, but if “a horseman is riding along a
gravelly road past this target, and one of the
pebbles thrown up by the hoof of the galloping
horse hits the mark, this would be termed an
accident of extremely rare occurrence. My target
was not the mark for the pebble, therefore
the hit was purely accidental, although the projection
of the stone in this precise direction with
the velocity which it had acquired, was sufficiently
explained by the kick given by the horse. But
the hit was accidental because the kick of the
galloping horse, although it necessarily projected
the pebble, had no relation at all to my target.
For the same reason we must regard the universe
as an immense accident if the forces which move
it are not designedly regulated&mdash;the more immense
because it is not a single motion of projection
that acts here, but a large number of heterogeneous
powers, <i>i.e.</i> a large number of variously
acting necessities which are, as a whole, devoid
of purpose, but which nevertheless accomplish
this purpose, not only at any single moment, but
constantly. A truly admirable series of desirable
<span class="locked">accidents!”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span></p>

<p>The same idea is expressed, although in a very
different manner, by Von Hartmann, in the concluding
chapter of his work already quoted. He
thinks that “design is a necessary and certain
consequence of the mechanical laws of nature.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
“Were the mechanism of natural laws not teleological
there would be no mechanically regulated
laws, but a weak chaos of obstinate and capricious
powers. Not until the causality of the laws of
inorganic nature had superseded the expression
“dead” nature, and had shown itself as the mainspring
of life and of a conformability to design
visible on all sides, did it deserve the name of
mechanical lawfulness; just as a complication of
wheels and machinery made by man, which move
in some definite manner with respect to one
another, only acquires the name of a mechanism
or of a machine when the immanent teleology of
the combination and of the various movements of
the parts is <span class="locked">revealed.”<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span></p>

<p>Against the correctness of the idea underlying
these statements scarcely anything can in my
opinion be said. The harmony of the universe and
of that portion of it which we designate organic
nature, cannot be explained by chance, <i>i.e.</i> without
a common ground for co-operating necessities;
by the side of mere mechanism it is impossible
not to acknowledge a teleological principle&mdash;the
only question is, in what manner can we conceive
this as acting without abandoning the purely
mechanical conception of nature?</p>

<p>This is obviously effected if, with Von Baer and
Von Hartmann, we permit the metaphysical
principle to interrupt the course of the mechanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span>
of nature, and if we consider both the former and
the latter to work together with equal power.
Von Hartmann expressly makes such an admission
under the name of an “internal principle of development,”
to which he attributes such an important
share that one cannot understand why it
should have any need for the employment of causal
powers, and why it does not simply do everything
itself. Von Baer expresses himself much less
decisively, and even in many places insists upon
the purely mechanical connection of organic
natural phenomena; but that with him also the
idea of interruption by a metaphysical principle is
present, is principally shown by his assuming, at
least partly, the <i>per saltum</i> development of species.
This necessarily involves an actively internal
power of development.</p>

<p>Although I have already brought forward many
arguments against the existence of such a power,
and although in refuting it every form of development
by directive powers is at the same time
overthrown, it nevertheless appears to me not to
be superfluous in such a deeply important question
to show that a <i>per saltum</i> development, and
especially the so-called heterogeneous generation,
is inconceivable, not only on the ground of the
arguments formerly employed against the phyletic
vital force in general, but quite independently of
these.</p>

<p>In the first place it must be said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
positive basis of this hypothesis is insecure.
Cases of sudden transformation of the whole
organism with subsequent inheritance are as yet
quite unknown. It has been shown that the
occasional transformation of the Axolotl must
most probably be regarded in a different light.
Another case, taken for heterogeneous generation,
viz. the budding of twelve-rayed Medusæ in the
gastric cavity of an eight-rayed species, has
lately been shown by Franz Eilhard <span class="locked">Schulze<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span> to
be a kind of parasitism or commensalism. The
buds of the <i>Cuninæ</i> do not spring, as was supposed,
from the <i>Geryonia</i>, but are developed from
a <i>Cunina</i> egg. But even if we recall here the
cases of alternation of generation and heterogenesis,
this would not be of any value by way of
proof; it would only be thus indicated how one
might picture to oneself a sudden transformation.
That in alternation of generation, or generally, in
every mode of cyclical reproduction, we have not
to deal with the abandonment of one type of
organization and the transition to some other, is
proved by the continual return to the type of departure&mdash;by
the cyclical character of the entire
transformation. That two quite heterogeneous
types can belong to one cycle of development is,
however, capable of a far better and more correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
explanation than would be given by the supporters
of <i>per saltum</i> development. If we trace cyclical
reproduction to the adaptation of different developmental
stages or generations to deviating
conditions of life, we thus not only explain
the exact and often striking agreement between
form and mode of life&mdash;we not only bridge over
the gap between metamorphosis and alternation
of generation, but we can also understand how,
within one and the same family of Hydrozoa,
species can occur with or without alternation of
generation, and further how other species can
exist in which the alternation of generation (the
production of free Medusæ) is limited to the one
sex; we can understand in general how one continuous
series of forms may lead from the simple
sexual organ of the Polypes to the independent
and free swimming sexual form of the Medusæ,
and how hand in hand with this the simple reproduction
becomes gradually cyclical. It is just
these intermediate steps between the two kinds of
reproduction that make quite untenable the idea
that the heterogeneous forms in cyclical propagation
arise through so-called “heterogeneous
generation,” <i>i.e.</i> through sudden <i>per saltum</i>
transformation. It is excusable if philosophers
to whom these facts are strange, or who have to
take the trouble of working them up, should
adduce alternation of generation as an instance
of “heterogeneous generation,” but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
naturalists this should be once and for ever
abandoned.</p>

<p>All other facts which have hitherto been
referred to “heterogeneous generation” are still
less explicable as such, inasmuch as they always
relate to changes in single parts of an organism,
such as the sudden change of fruit or flower in
cultivated plants. The notion of <i>per saltum</i> development,
however, demands a total transformation&mdash;it
comprises (as Von Hartmann quite
correctly and logically admits) the idea of a <i>fixed
specific type</i> which can only be re-modelled <i>as a
whole</i>, and cannot become modified piecemeal.
It must further be added, that the observed
variations which have arisen abruptly in single
parts are not as a rule <span class="locked">inherited:<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> fruit-trees are
only propagated by grafting, <i>i.e.</i> by perpetuating
the individual, and not by ordinary reproduction
by seeds. Now, if we nowhere see sudden variations
of large amount perpetuated by heredity,
whilst we everywhere observe small variations
which can all be inherited, must it not be concluded
that <i>per saltum</i> modification is not the
means which Nature employs in transforming
species, but that an accumulation of small variations
takes place, these leading in time to large
differences? Is it logical to reject the latter conclusion
because our period of observation is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
brief to enable us to directly follow long series of
accumulations, whilst <i>per saltum</i> variation is admitted,
although unsupported by a single observation?
As long as there remains any prospect
of tracing large deviations to the continually
observed phenomenon of small variations, I believe
we have no right to resort to the purely hypothetical
explanation afforded by <i>per saltum</i> variations.</p>

<p>But the hypothesis of “heterogeneous generation”
is not only without a basis of facts&mdash;it can
also be directly shown to be untenable. Since
the operation of an internal power of transformation
does not explain adaptation to the conditions
of life, the claims of natural selection to explain
these transformations must be admitted; but the
co-operation of a phyletic vital force and natural
selection is inconceivable if we imagine the modifications
to occur <i>per saltum</i>.</p>

<p>The supposed “heterogeneous generation” is
always illustrated by the example of alternation of
generation. The origination of a new animal
form is thus conceived to take place in the same
manner as we now see, in the cyclical reproduction
of the Medusæ, free swimming, bell-shaped
Medusoids, produced from fixed polypites, or
<i>Cercariæ</i> from Trematode worms by internal
budding; in brief, it is imagined that one animal
form suddenly gives rise to another widely deviating
form by purely internal causes. Now on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
this theory it would be an unavoidable postulate,
that by such a process of <i>per saltum</i> development
there arises not merely a new type of some
species, but at the same time individuals capable
of living and of persisting under, and fitted to,
given conditions of life. But every naturalist who
has attempted to completely explain the relation
between structure and mode of life knows that
even the small differences which separate one
species from another, always comprise a number
of minute structural deviations which are related
to well defined conditions of life&mdash;he knows that
in every species of animal the whole structure is
adapted in the most exact manner <i>in every detail</i>
to special conditions of life. It is not an exaggeration
when I say in every detail, since the
so-called “purely morphological parts” could not
be other than they are without causing changes in
other parts which exercise a definite function. I
will not indeed assert that in the most closely
related species all the parts of the body must in
some manner differ from one another, if only to a
small extent; it seems to me not improbable,
however, that an exact comparison would very
frequently give this result. That animals which
are so widely removed in their morphological
relations as Medusæ and Polypes, or Trematoda
and their “nurses,” are differently constructed
in each of their parts can, however, be stated
with certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span></p>

<p>Now if this wide deviation in every part were in
itself no obstacle to the assumption of a designing
and re-modelling power, it would become so by
the circumstance that all the parts of the organism
must stand in the most precise relation to the
external conditions of life, if the organism is to be
capable of existing&mdash;all the parts must be exactly
adapted to certain conditions of life. How can
this be brought about by a transforming force
acting spasmodically? Von Hartmann&mdash;who, in
spite of his clear perception and widely extended
scientific knowledge, cannot possibly possess a
strong conviction of that harmony between structure
and life-conditions prevailing throughout the whole
system of the organism, and which personal research
and contemplation are alone able to give&mdash;simply
bridges over the difficulty by permitting
natural selection to come to his aid as an
“auxiliary principle” of the re-modelling power.
It would not be supposed that naturalists would
resort to the same device&mdash;nevertheless those who
support the phyletic force and <i>per saltum</i> development
generally invoke natural selection as
the principle which governs adaptation. But
when does this agency come into operation?
When by germinal metamorphosis a new form
has arisen, this, from the first moment of its existence,
must be adapted to the new conditions of
life or it must perish. No time is allowed for it
to continue in an unadapted state throughout a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
series of generations until adaptation is luckily
reached through natural selection. Let us have
either natural selection or a phyletic force&mdash;both
together are inconceivable. If there exists
a phyletic force, then it must itself bring about
adaptation.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be here suggested that the
same objection applies to that process of modification
which is effected by small steps, but that
it does so only when the change occurs suddenly.
This, however, as I have already attempted to
show, but very rarely takes place; in many cases
(mimicry) the conditions even change in the first
place through the change in form and therefore,
as is evident, as gradually as the latter. It must
be the same in all other cases where transformation
of the existing form and not merely extinction
of the species concerned takes place. The
transmutation must always keep pace with the
change in the conditions of life, since if the latter
change more rapidly the species could not
compete with rival species&mdash;it would become
extinct.</p>

<p>The abrupt transformation of species implies
sudden change in the conditions of life, since a
Medusa does not live like a Polype, nor a Trematode
like its “nurse.” For this reason it is impossible
that natural selection can be an aiding
principle of “heterogeneous generation.” If such
abrupt transformation takes place it must produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
the new form instantly equipped for the struggle
for existence, and adapted in all its organs and
systems of organs to the special conditions of its
new life. But would not this be “pure magic”?
It is not thereby even taken into consideration
that here&mdash;as in the cases of mimicry&mdash;time and
place must agree. The requirements of a pre-established
harmony (“<i>prästabilirte Harmonie</i>”)
further demand that an animal fitted for special
conditions of life should only make its appearance
at that precise period of the earth’s history when
these special conditions are all fulfilled, and so
forth.</p>

<p>But he who has learnt to perceive the numerous
and fine relations which, in every species of
animal, bring the details of structure into harmony
with function, and who keeps in view the impelling
power of these conditions, cannot possibly hold
to the idea of a <i>per saltum</i> development of
animal forms. If development has taken place, it
must have occurred gradually and by minute steps&mdash;in
such a manner indeed that each modification
had time to become equilibrated to the other
parts, and in this way a succession of modifications
gradually brought about the total transformation
of the organism, and at the same time
secured complete adaptation to new conditions
of life.</p>

<p>Not only abrupt modification however, but
every transformation is to be rejected when based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
upon the interference of a metaphysical principle
of development. Those to whom the arguments
already advanced against such a principle appear
insufficient may once more be asked, how and
where should this principle properly interfere? I
am of opinion that one effect can have but
one sufficient cause; if this suffices to produce it,
no second cause is required. The hand of a
watch necessarily turns once round in a circle in a
given time as soon as the spring which sets the
mechanism in movement is wound up; in an unwound
watch a skilful finger can perhaps give the
same movement to the hand, but it is impossible
that the latter can receive both from the operator
and from the spring at <i>the same time, the same
motion</i> as that which it would receive through
either of these two powers <i>alone</i>. In the same
manner it appears to me that the variations which
lead to transformation cannot be at the same
time determined by physical and by metaphysical
causes, but must depend upon either one or the
other.</p>

<p>On no side will it be disputed that at least one
portion of the processes of organic life depends
upon the mechanical co-operation of physical
forces. How is it conceivable that sudden pauses
should occur in the course of these causal forces,
and that a directive power should be substituted
therefor, the latter subsequently making way
again for the physical forces? To me this is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">708</a></span>
inconceivable as the idea that lightning is the
electric discharge of a thunder-cloud, of which the
formation and electrical tension depends upon
causal forces, and of which the time and place are
purely determined by such forces, but that Jupiter
has it nevertheless in his power to direct the
lightning flash according to his will on to the
head of the guilty.</p>

<p>Now although I deny the possibility or conceivability
of the contemporaneous co-operation
of teleological and of causal forces in producing
any effect, and although I maintain that a purely
mechanical conception of the processes of nature
is alone justifiable, I nevertheless believe that
there is no occasion for this reason to renounce
the existence of, or to disown, a directive power;
only we must not imagine this to interfere directly
in the mechanism of the universe, but to be rather
behind the latter as the final cause of this
mechanism.</p>

<p>Von Baer himself points this out to us, although
he does not follow up the complete consequences
of his arguments. He especially insists in his
book, which abounds in beautiful and grand ideas,
that the notions of necessity (causality) and of
purpose by no means necessarily exclude one
another, but rather that they can be connected
together in a certain manner. Thus, the watchmaker
attains his end, the watch, by combining
the elastic force of a spring with wheel-work, <i>i.e.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
by utilizing physical necessities; the farmer
accomplishes his purpose, that of obtaining a
crop of corn, by sowing the seed in suitable land,
but the seed must germinate as an absolute
necessity when exposed to the influences of
warmth, soil, moisture, &amp;c. Thus, in these instances
a chain of necessities is undoubtedly
connected with a teleological force, the human
will; and it directly follows from such cases that
wherever we see an aim or result attained through
necessities, the directive force does not interrupt
the course of the series of necessities which have
already commenced, but is active before the first
commencement of these necessities, since it combines
and sets the latter in movement. From the
moment when the mechanism of the watch is
combined harmoniously and the spring wound up,
it goes without the further interference of the
watchmaker, just as the corn-seed when once
placed in the earth develops into a plant without
assistance from the farmer.</p>

<p>If we apply this argument to the development
of the organic world, those who defend mechanical
development will not be compelled to deny a
teleological power, only they would have with
<span class="locked">Kant<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span> to think of the latter in the only way in
which it can be conceived, viz. <i>as a Final Cause</i>.</p>

<p>In the region of inorganic nature nobody any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
longer doubts the purely mechanical connection
of the phenomena. Sunshine and rain do not
now appear to us to be whims of a deity, but
divine natural laws. As the knowledge of the
processes of nature advances, the point where the
divine power designedly interrupts these processes
must be removed further back; or, as the author
of the criticism of the philosophy of the <span class="locked">Unconscious<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span>
expresses it, all advance in the knowledge
of natural processes depends “upon the
continual elimination of the idea of the miraculous.”
We now believe that organic nature must
be conceived as mechanical. But does it thereby
follow that we must totally deny a final Universal
Cause? Certainly not; it would be a great
delusion if any one were to believe that he had
arrived at a comprehension of the universe by
tracing the phenomena of nature to mechanical
principles. He would thereby forget that the
assumption of eternal matter with its eternal laws
by no means satisfies our intellectual need for
causality. We require before everything an explanation
of the fact that relationships everywhere
exist between the parts of the universe&mdash;that
atoms everywhere act upon one <span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> He
who can content himself with the assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
of matter may do so, but he will not be able
to show that the assumption of a Universal Cause
underlying the laws of nature is erroneous.</p>

<p>It will not be said that there is no advantage in
assuming such a Final Cause, because we cannot
conceive it, and indeed cannot so much as demonstrate
it with certainty. It certainly lies beyond
our power of conception, in the obscure region of
metaphysics, and all attempts to approach it have
never led to anything but an image or a formula.
Nevertheless there is an advance in knowledge in
the assumption of this Cause which well admits of
comparison with those advances which have been
led to by certain results of the new physiology of
the senses. We now know that the images which
give us our sense of the external world are not
“actual representations having any degree of
<span class="locked">resemblance,”<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span> but are only signs for certain qualities
of the outer world, which do not exist as such
in the latter, but belong entirely to our consciousness.
Thus we know for certain that the world
is not as we perceive it&mdash;that we cannot perceive
“things in their essence”&mdash;and that the reality will
always remain transcendental to us. But who
will deny that in this knowledge there is a considerable
advance, in spite of its being for the most
part of a negative character? But just as we
must assume behind the phenomenal world of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
senses an actual world of the true nature of which
we receive only an incomplete knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> a
knowledge corresponding only in reality with the
relations of time and space), so behind the co-operating
forces of nature which “aim at a purpose”
must we admit a Cause, which is no less
inconceivable in its nature, and of which we can
only say one thing with certainty, viz., that it must
be teleological. Just as the former first leads
us to perceive the true value of our sensual impressions,
so does the latter knowledge lead us to
foresee the true significance of the mechanism of
the universe.</p>

<p>It is true that in neither case do we learn more
than that there is something present which we do
not perceive, but in both instances this knowledge
is of the greatest value. The consciousness that
behind that mechanism of the universe which is
alone comprehensible to us there still lies an
incomprehensible teleological Universal Cause, necessitates
quite a different conception of the universe&mdash;a
conception absolutely opposed to that of
the materialist. Most correctly and beautifully
does Von Baer say that “a purpose cannot be
otherwise conceived by us than as proceeding
from a will and consciousness; in this would the
‘aiming at a purpose,’ which appears to us as
reasonable as it is necessary, have its deepest
root.” If we conceive in this world a divine Universal
Power exercising volition as the ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
basis of matter and of the natural laws resident
therein, we thus reconcile the apparent contradiction
between the mechanical conception and teleology.
In the same way that Von Hartmann,
somewhere speaks of the immanent teleology of a
machine, we might speak of the immanent teleology
of the universe, because the single forces of
matter are so exactly adjusted that they must give
rise to the projected world, just as the wheels and
levers of a machine bring forth a required manufactured
article. I admit that these are grossly
anthropomorphic ideas. But as mortals can we
have any other ideas? Is not the notion of purpose
in itself an equally anthropomorphic one? and is
there any certainty that the idea of causality is
less so? Do we know that causality is unlimited,
or that it is universally valid? In the absence of
this knowledge, should it not be permissible to
satisfy as far as we can the craving of the human
mind for a spiritual First Cause of the universe, by
speaking of it in terms conceivable to human
understanding? We can take up such a final
position and still be conscious that we thereby
form no certain conception, and indeed come no
nearer to the reality. The materialist still makes
use of the notion of “eternity,” and frequently
handles it as though it were a perfectly known
quantity. We nevertheless do not seriously believe
that by the expression “eternal matter,” any true
idea resulting from human experience is gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span></p>

<p>If it is asked, however, how that which in
ourselves and in the remainder of the animal
world is <i>intellectual</i> and <i>perceptive</i>, which <i>thinks</i>
and <i>wills</i>, is ascribable to a mechanical process of
organic development&mdash;whether the development
of the mind can be conceived as resulting from
purely mechanical laws? I answer unhesitatingly
in the affirmative with the pure materialist, although
I do not agree with him as to the manner in which
he derives these phenomena from matter, since
thinking and extension are heterogeneous things,
and one cannot be considered as a product of the
other. But why should not the ancient notion of
“conscious matter” given out by Maupertuis and
Robinet, not be again entertained, as pointed out
in recent times by Fechner?<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Would there not
thus be found a useful formula for explaining
phenomena hitherto quite incomprehensible?</p>

<p>Von Hartmann in criticizing himself, designates
the sensibility of atoms as an “almost inevitable
hypothesis” (p. 62), “inevitable because if sensibility
were not a general and original property of
the constituent elements of matter, it would be
absolutely incomprehensible how through its
potentiality and integration that sensibility known
to us as being possessed by the organism could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
have arisen.” “It is impossible that from purely
external elements devoid of all internality (<i>Innerlichkeit</i>)
there should suddenly appear, by a
certain mode of combination, an internality which
becomes more and more richly developed. The
more certainly science becomes convinced that in
the sphere of externality (<i>Äusserlichkeit</i>) the higher
(organic) phenomena are only results of combination,
or are the aggregate phenomena of the
elementary atomic forces, the more surely, when
she once seriously concerns herself with this other
question, will she not fail to be convinced that the
sensibility possessed by higher stages of consciousness
can be only combination-results, or the
aggregate phenomena of the elementary sensations
of atoms, although these atomic sensations as
such always remain below the level of the higher
combinations of consciousness.” In confusing
this double-sided nature of the objective phenomenon
“lies the main error of all materialism and
of all subjective idealism. Just as the attempt of
the latter (subjective idealism) to construct the
external phenomena of existence in space out of
functions of internality and their combinations is
impossible, so is the endeavour of the former
(materialism) to build up internal sensation out of
any combinations of force acting externally in
space equally impossible.”</p>

<p>I have no intention of going any deeper into
these questions. I mention them only in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span>
point out that even from this side there appears to
me no obstacle in the way of a purely mechanical
conception of the processes of the universe. The
naturalist may be excused if he attempts to penetrate
into the region of philosophy; it arises from
the wish to be able to contribute a little towards
the reconciliation of the latest knowledge of the
naturalist with the religious wants of the human mind&mdash;towards
the aim striven for by both sides, viz. a
satisfactory and harmonious view of the universe,
according with the state of knowledge of our time.</p>

<p>I believe that I have shown that the theory
of selection by no means leads&mdash;as is always
assumed&mdash;to the denial of a teleological Universal
Cause and to materialism, and I thereby hope
that I have cleared the way for this doctrine, the
importance of which it is scarcely possible to over-estimate.
Many, and not the most ill-informed,
do not get so far as to make an unbiassed examination
into the facts, because they are at the outset
alarmed by the to them inevitable consequence of
the materialistic conception of the universe. Mechanism
and teleology do not exclude one another,
they are rather in mutual agreement. Without
teleology there would be no mechanism, but only
a confusion of crude forces; and without mechanism
there would be no teleology, for how could the
latter otherwise effect its purpose?<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>Von Hartmann correctly says:&mdash;“The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
complete mechanism conceivable is likewise the
most completely conceivable teleology.” We
may thus represent the phenomenal universe
as such a completely conceivable mechanism.
With this conception vanish all apprehensions
that the new views would cause man to lose
the best that he possesses&mdash;morality and purely
human spiritual culture. He who, with Von
Baer, considers the laws of nature as the “permanent
expressions of the will of a creative principle,”
will clearly perceive that a further advance
in the knowledge of these laws need not divert
man from the path of increasing improvement, but
must further him in this course&mdash;that the knowledge
of truth, whatever may be its purport, cannot
possibly be considered a backward step. Let us
take our stand boldly on the ground of new
knowledge, and accept the direct consequences
thereof, and we shall not be obliged to give up
either morality or the comforting conviction of
being part of an harmonious world, as a necessary
member capable of development and perfection.</p>

<p>Any other mode of interference by a directive
teleological power in the processes of the universe
than by the appointment of the forces producing
them, is however, at least to the naturalist, inadmissible.
We are still far removed from completely
understanding the mechanism by means of
which the organic world is evoked&mdash;we still find
ourselves at the very beginning of knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">718</a></span>
We are, however, already convinced that both the
organic and the inorganic worlds are dependent
only upon mechanical forces, for to this conclusion
we are led, not only by the results of investigators
who have restricted themselves to limited provinces,
but also by the most general considerations.
But although the force of these arguments may
not be acknowledged, and although one might
maintain that the inductional proofs against the
existence of a “phyletic vital force” have been
directed only against points of detail, or have
never been completely demonstrated, <i>i.e.</i> for all
points, it must nevertheless be conceded, that for
the naturalist the mechanical conception of Nature
is the only one possible&mdash;that he is not at all
justified in abandoning this view so long as the
interference of teleological forces <i>in the course</i> of
the processes of organic development has not
been demonstrated to him. Thus, it will not be
immaterial whether a conception of Nature which
to many seems inevitable is consistent with the
idea of universal design, or a final directive universal
principle, since the value which we may
attach to our own lives and aims, essentially
depends thereon. The final and main result of
this essay will thus be found in the attempted
demonstration that the mechanical conception of
Nature very well admits of being united with a
teleological conception of the Universe.</p>

on the nature of insect ancestors, it does nevertheless appear
to me probable that such forms as the caterpillars of the Lepidoptera

to conceive that even a secondary larval form may have been
produced by the prolongation of one of the embryonic stages;
and the general similarity of a caterpillar to <i>Peripatus</i>, and the
retention by it of post-thoracic appendages, are facts which appear

fact that in a majority of instances it is possible to trace an
intimate connection between the surroundings of a larva and
its organization proves in the clearest way <i>that the characters
of the majority of existing larval forms of insects have owed their
origin to secondary adaptations</i>. A few instances will illustrate
this point:&mdash;In the simplest types of metamorphosis, <i>e.g.</i> those
of the Orthoptera genuina, the larva has precisely the same
habits as the adult. We find that a caterpillar form is assumed
by phytophagous larvæ amongst the Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera,
and Coleoptera. Where the larva has not to go in search
of its nutriment the grub-like apodous form is assumed. The
existence of such an apodous larva is especially striking in
the Hymenoptera, in that rudiments of thoracic and abdominal
appendages are present in the embryo and disappear again in
the larva.... It follows from the above that the development
of such forms as the Orthoptera genuina is more primitive
than that of the holometabolous forms, &amp;c.” Comparative

Axolotl. If, therefore, we apply the term “atavism” only to
such characters or stages (<i>i.e.</i> complexes of characters) as are
no longer preserved in the ontogeny, we cannot thus designate
the present arrest of the Axolotl at the perennibranchiate stage.
Such a restriction of the word, however, appears to me but
little desirable, since the process is identical in both cases, <i>i.e.</i>
it depends upon the same law of heredity, in accordance with
which a condition formerly occurring as a phyletic stage
suddenly reappears through purely internal processes. It is
true that the reversion is not <i>complete</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the present
sexually mature Axolotl does not correspond in all details
with its perennibranchiate ancestors. Since Wiedersheim has
shown that the existing Axolotl possesses an intermaxillary
gland, this can be safely asserted. This gland occurs only in
<i>land</i> Amphibians, and therefore originated with the Amblystoma
form, afterwards becoming transferred secondarily to
the larval stage. Nevertheless, the present Axolotl must
resemble its perennibranchiate ancestors in most other characters,
and we should be the more entitled to speak of a reversion
to the perennibranchiate stage as we speak also of the
reversion of single characters. To this must be added that
the Axolotl does not correspond exactly with an Amblystoma
larva, since Wiedersheim has shown that the space for the
intermaxillary gland is present, but that the gland itself is
confined to a few tubes which do not by any means fill up
this space. (“Das Kopfskelet der Urodelen.” Morph. Jahrbuch,
vol. iii. p. 149). By the expression “arrested growth”
not much is said, if at the same time the cause of the arrest
is left unstated. But what can be the cause why the whole
organization remains stationary at the perennibranchiate stage,
the sexual organs only undergoing further development?
Surely only that law or force of heredity known by its effects,
but obscure with respect to its causes, through which old
phyletic stages sometimes suddenly reappear, or in other words,
that power through which reversion takes place. It must not
be forgotten that all these cases of “larval reproduction” in
Amphibians appear suddenly. The present sexually mature
form of the Axolotl has not arisen by the sexual maturity gradually
receding in the ontogeny from generation to generation,
but by the occurrence of single individuals which were sexually
mature in the perennibranchiate stage, these having the advantage
over the <i>Amblystomæ</i> in the struggle for existence under
changed climatic conditions.
</p>
<p>
By admitting a reversion, we perfectly well explain why arrest
at the perennibranchiate stage can be associated with complete
development of the sexual organs; the assumption of an
“arrested growth” leaves this combination of characters completely
unexplained. Moreover, I am of opinion that the
expressions “arrested growth” or “reversion” are of but
little importance so long as the matter itself is clear.]</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_256" id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> [Eng. ed. It was mentioned in the German edition of
this work that in the spring of 1876 a female Amblystoma of
the Jardin des Plantes in Paris had laid eggs (see Blanchard in
the Compt. Rend. 1876, No. 13, p. 716). Whether these eggs
were fertile, or whether they developed was not then made known.
Thus much was however at the time clear, that even if this
had been the case, the reproduction of this Amblystoma would
have been only an <i>exceptional</i> occurrence. At that time there
were in the Jardin des Plantes Amblystomas which had been
kept for more than ten years, and only on one occasion was
there a deposition of eggs, and this by only one specimen.
That I was correct in speaking of the “sterility” of these
Amblystomas in spite of this one exception, is proved by the
latest communication from the Jardin des Plantes. We learn
from this (Compt. Rend. No. 14, July, 1879, p. 108) that in
the years 1877 and 1878 none of the Amblystomas laid any
more eggs, although all means were exerted to bring about
propagation. In April, 1879, eggs were again laid by one
female, and by a second in May. These eggs certainly developed,
as did those of 1876, and produced tadpoles. These
Amblystomas are therefore not absolutely, but indeed relatively
sterile. Whilst the Axolotl propagates regularly and freely every
year, this occurs with the Amblystoma but rarely and sparsely.
The degree of their sterility can only be approximately established
when we know the number of Amblystomas that have
since been kept in the Jardin des Plantes. Unfortunately
nothing has been said with respect to this.]</p></div>

430) with reference to the Axolotl of Lake Como in the Rocky
Mountains, which he states always becomes transformed into
<i>Amblystoma Mavortium</i>, that this metamorphosis “takes place
in the water, and the Amblystomas, so long as they are little,
actually live exclusively in the water, as I know by my own
experience. A young Amblystoma which I kept alive for a
long time, never went out of the water of its own free will,
while one nearly twice as large lives entirely on land and only
takes a bath now and then. It always goes into the water when
the temperature of the air in the cellar, in which my aquaria
stand, falls below that of the water&mdash;down to about 6° or 8° C.”
This statement appears to suggest that the effect of temperature
may be a factor in some way concerned in these interesting
cases of transformation, and would in any case be well
worthy of experimental investigation. Some further details
concerning the <i>Siredon Lichenoides</i> of Lake Como have been
recently published by Mr. W. E. Carlin (Proc. U.S. National
Museum, June, 1881). The lake, which is shallow, is fed by
a constant stream of fresh water, but the water of the lake is
intensely saline. The Siredon never enter the fresh water
stream, but congregate in large numbers in the alkaline waters
of the lake. “When about one hundred and fifty were placed
in fresh water they seemed to suffer no inconvenience, but it
had a remarkable effect in hastening their metamorphosis into
the Amblystoma form. Of an equal number kept in fresh
water and in the lake water, quite a change occurred with the
former after twenty-four hours, while the latter showed no
change after several days of captivity. Those that were kept
well fed in jars usually began to show a slight change in from
two to three weeks, and all of them completed the change into
the Amblystoma inside of six weeks, while in some kept, but
not specially fed, there were but three changes in three
months.” (Nature, Aug. 25th, 1881, p. 388.) R.M.]</p></div>

occur between species both of which are apparently nauseous.
A most able discussion of this difficult problem is given by
Fritz Müller, in the case of the two butterflies <i>Ituna Ilione</i>
and <i>Thyridia Megisto</i>, in a paper published in <i>Kosmos</i>, May,
1879 (p. 100). The author shows by mathematical reasoning
that such resemblances between protected species can be
accounted for by natural selection if we suppose that young
birds and other insect persecutors have to learn by experience
which species are distasteful and which can be safely devoured.

respect to the direct action of the conditions of life as producing
variability, that in every case there are two factors,

perhaps be well to remind the general reader, that all experiments
upon spontaneous generation, or abiogenesis, have
hitherto yielded negative results; no life is produced when the
proper precautions are taken for excluding atmospheric germs.
But although we have so far failed to reproduce in our
laboratories the peculiar combination of conditions necessary
to endow colloidal organic matter with the property of
“vitality,” the consistent evolutionist is bound to believe,
from the analogy of the whole of the processes of nature, that
at some period of the earth’s history the necessary physical and
chemical conditions obtained, and that some simple form or
forms of life arose “spontaneously,” <i>i.e.</i> by the operation of

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks were corrected.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>“Errata” at the end of this Volume have been applied to the relevant
text of this eBook.</p>

<p>This is Volume II of a two-volume set. The Table of Contents for both
volumes is in Volume I.</p>

<p>The Index for both volumes is in this one. References to pages
1&ndash;400 will be found in Volume I.</p>

<p>Footnotes and references to them have been renumbered into one
continuous sequence and moved to the end of the text of this eBook,
immediately preceding the Index. The sequence begins at “171” because
there are 170 footnotes in Volume I. Some “See note” references may be
incorrect.</p>

<p>Reading devices that cannot display some of the characters in this
eBook may substitute question marks or other placeholders.</p>
